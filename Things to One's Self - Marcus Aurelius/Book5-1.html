          Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and those to come.
          Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a
          thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past
          and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.</span

          The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the
          flesh—gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and
          keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into your thoughts,
          through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don’t try to resist the sensation. The
          sensation is natural. But don’t let the mind start in with judgments, calling it “good” or
          “bad.”</span
