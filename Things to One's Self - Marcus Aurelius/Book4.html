          Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what
          it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as
          circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have
          quenched a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it—and
          makes it burn still higher.</span

          People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You

          Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves.
          Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was—no better and no worse.
          This applies, I think, even to “beautiful” things in ordinary life—physical objects,
          artworks.</span
