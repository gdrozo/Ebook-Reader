          Another encouragement to humility: you can’t claim to have lived your life as a
          philosopher—not even your whole adulthood. You can see for yourself how far you are from
          philosophy. And so can many others. You’re tainted. It’s not so easy now—to have a
          reputation as a philosopher. And your position is an obstacle as well.</span

          don’t let anything distract you. You’ve wandered all over and finally realized that you
          never found what you were after: how to live. Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame, or

          Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress. And progress for a rational mind means not
          accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only
          aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature
          demands of it—the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the
          tree’s. Except that the nature shared by the leaf is without consciousness or reason, and
          subject to impediments. Whereas that shared by human beings is without impediments, and
          rational, and just, since it allots to each and every thing an equal and proportionate
          share of time, being, purpose, action, chance. Examine it closely. Not whether they’re
          identical point by point, but in the aggregate: this weighed against that.</span

          We have various abilities, present in all rational creatures as in the nature of
          rationality itself. And this is one of them. Just as nature takes every obstacle, every
          impediment, and works around it—turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself—so,
          too, a rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to achieve its

          For animate beings, “harmful” is whatever obstructs the operation of their senses—or the
