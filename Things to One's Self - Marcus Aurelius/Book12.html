          God sees all our souls freed from their fleshly containers, stripped clean of their bark,
          cleansed of their grime. He grasps with his intelligence alone what was poured and
          channeled from himself into them. If you learn to do the same, you can avoid a great deal
          of distress. When you see through the flesh that covers you, will you be unsettled by
          clothing, mansions, celebrity—the painted sets, the costume cupboard?</span

          It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more
          about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us—or a wise human being, even—and
          prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately
          shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how much we value other
          people’s opinions—instead of our own.</span

          How is it that the gods arranged everything with such skill, such care for our well-being,
          and somehow overlooked one thing: that certain people—in fact, the best of them, the gods’
          own partners, the ones whose piety and good works brought them closest to the divine—that
          these people, when they die, should cease to exist forever? Utterly vanished.</span

          Well, assuming that’s really true, you can be sure they would have arranged things
          differently, if that had been appropriate. If it were the right thing to do, they could
          have done it, and if it were natural, nature would have demanded it. So from the fact that
          they didn’t—if that’s the case—we can conclude that it was inappropriate.</span
