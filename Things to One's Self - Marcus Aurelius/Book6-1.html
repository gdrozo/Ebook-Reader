          Things ordinary people are impressed by fall into the categories of things that are held
          together by simple physics (like stones or wood), or by natural growth (figs, vines,
          olives . . .). Those admired by more advanced minds are held together by a living soul
          (flocks of sheep, herds of cows). Still more sophisticated people admire what is guided by
          a rational mind—not the universal mind, but one admired for its technical knowledge, or
          for some other skill—or just because it happens to own a lot of slaves.</span
