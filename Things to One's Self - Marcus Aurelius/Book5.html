          At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work—as
          a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the
          things I was brought into the world to do? Or is <em class="italic">this</em> what I was

          tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job

          Just as you overhear people saying that “the doctor prescribed such-and-such for him”
          (like riding, or cold baths, or walking barefoot . . .), say this: “Nature prescribed
          illness for him.” Or blindness. Or the loss of a limb. Or whatever. There “prescribed”
          means something like “ordered, so as to further his recovery.” And so too here. What
          happens to each of us is ordered. It furthers our destiny.</span

    <div class="calibre_7">
      <p class="au">
        <span class="calibre3">
          And when we describe things as “taking place,” we’re talking like builders, who say that
          blocks in a wall or a pyramid “take their place” in the structure, and fit together in a
          harmonious pattern.</span

    <div class="calibre_7">

        <span class="calibre3">
          For there is a single harmony. Just as the world forms a single body comprising all
          bodies, so fate forms a single purpose, comprising all purposes. Even complete illiterates
          acknowledge it when they say that something “brought on” this or that. Brought on, yes. Or
          prescribed it. And in that case, let’s accept it—as we accept what the doctor prescribes.
          It may not always be pleasant, but we embrace it—because we want to get well. Look at the
          accomplishment of nature’s plans in that light—the way you look at your own health—and
          accept what happens (even if it seems hard to accept). Accept it because of what it leads
          to: the good health of the world, and the well-being and prosperity of Zeus himself, who
          would not have brought this on anyone unless it brought benefit to the world as a whole.
          No nature would do that—bring something about that wasn’t beneficial to what it
          governed.</span

          So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to
          <em class="italic">you.</em> It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread
          was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.</span

    <div class="calibre_7">
      <p class="au">

          The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what
          directs the world—of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence, even. Because
          the whole is damaged if you cut away anything—anything at all—from its continuity and its
          coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that’s what you’re doing when you

          Things are wrapped in such a veil of mystery that many good philosophers have found it
          impossible to make sense of them. Even the Stoics have trouble. Any assessment we make is
          subject to alteration—just as we are ourselves.</span

          able to follow that line about “so many goods. . . .” It wouldn’t make any sense to you.
          Whereas if you’d internalized the conventional meaning, you’d be able to follow it

          Nothing pertains to human beings except what defines us as human. No other things can be
          demanded of us. They aren’t proper to human nature, nor is it incomplete without them. It
          follows that they are not our goal, or what helps us reach it—the good. If any of them
          were proper to us, it would be improper to disdain or resist it. Nor would we admire
          people who show themselves immune to it. If the things themselves were good, it could
          hardly be good to give them up. But in reality the more we deny ourselves such things (and
          things like them)—or are deprived of them involuntarily, even—the better we become.</span
