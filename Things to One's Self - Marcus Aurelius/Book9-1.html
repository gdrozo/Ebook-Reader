          Epicurus: “During my illness, my conversations were not about my physical state; I did not
          waste my visitors’ time with things of that sort, but went on discussing philosophy, and
          concentrated on one point in particular: how the mind can participate in the sensations of
          the body and yet maintain its serenity, and focus on its own well-being. Nor did I let my

          And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about
          has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or
          “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of

          this way? The
          <em class="italic">logos</em> gave you the means to see it—that a given person would act a
          given way—but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it.
          So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself.
          It was <em class="italic">you</em> who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those
          traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return,
          instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from
          helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a
          salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking.
          That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing
          their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others—or
          help them to do something—we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our
