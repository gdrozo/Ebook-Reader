          To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do
          it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance,
          against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they
          haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.</span

          When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If
          you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good
          and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or
          your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and
          deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?</span

          you really are, regardless of what you may look like.” While Adaptability adds, “You’re
          just what I was looking for.” Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise of
          rational virtue—civic virtue—in short, the art that men share with gods. Both treat
          whatever happens as wholly natural; not novel or hard to deal with, but familiar and
