          Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other’s sake:
          to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to
          blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.</span

        <span class="calibre3">
          And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the nature of that which
          is. And that which is and that which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is
          synonymous with Truth—the source of all true things. To lie deliberately is to
          blaspheme—the liar commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without
          realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—its order. He is
          in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is
          opposed to the truth—even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to distinguish
          between true and false. And he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.</span

          And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too is blasphemous.
          Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly reproaching nature—complaining
          that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy
          pleasure and the things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things
          that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s bound to happen,
          the world being what it is—and that again is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you
          can hardly avoid wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.</span

          Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the other it would hardly

          share its indifference. To privilege pleasure over pain—life over death, fame over
          anonymity—is clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.</span

          Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever encountering dishonesty, or
          hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or pride. But the “next best voyage” is to die when you’ve
          had enough. Or are you determined to lie down with evil? Hasn’t experience even taught you
          <em class="italic">that—</em>to avoid it like the plague? Because it
          <em class="italic">is</em> a plague—a mental cancer—worse than anything caused by tainted
          air or an unhealthy climate. Diseases like that can only threaten your life; this one
          attacks your humanity.</span

          Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature.
          Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the
          first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical
          changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.</span

          So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with
          impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to
          us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should
          await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.</span

          Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well,
          consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll
          leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no
          need to feel resentment toward them—in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and
          be gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those
          you leave behind. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)—the only
          thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our
          vision. But now? Look how tiring it is—this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say
          to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.”</span

          All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing exists. All earthly things
          feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow together. And airy things as well, so they have
          to be forcibly prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher fire,
          but ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly flame. So that anything drier
          than usual makes good fuel, because less of what hinders combustion is mixed in with
          it.</span

          Because they do have souls, and the bonding instinct is found in a developed form—not
          something we see in plants, or stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational
          beings, with their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces. And
          in those yet more developed there is a kind of unity even between separate things, the
