          Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of their relatedness. All things
          are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the
          consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together,
          and are one.</span

          You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course
          when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred
          for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad
          behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our
          own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as
          enemies.</span

          All of us are working on the same project. Some consciously, with understanding; some
          without knowing it. (I think this is what Heraclitus meant when he said that “those who
          sleep are also hard at work”—that they too collaborate in what happens.) Some of us work
          in one way, and some in others. And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart
          things—they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well.</span

          will make good use of you regardless—will put you on its payroll and set you to work. But
