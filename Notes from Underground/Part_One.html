        I am a sick man . . . I am a wicked man. An unattractive man. I think my liver hurts.
        However, I don't know a fig about my sickness, and am not sure what it is that hurts me. I
        am not being treated and never have been, though I respect medicine and doctors. What's
        more, I am also superstitious in the extreme; well, at least enough to respect medicine.
        (I'm sufficiently educated not to be superstitious, but I am.) No, sir, I refuse to be
        treated out of wickedness. Now, you will certainly not be so good as to understand this.
        Well, sir, but I understand it. I will not, of course, be able to explain to you precisely
        who is going to suffer in this case from my wickedness; I know perfectly well that I will in
        no way “muck things up” for the doctors by not taking their treatment; I know better than
        anyone that by all this I am harming only myself and no one else. But still, if I don't get
        treated, it is out of wickedness. My liver hurts; well, then let it hurt even worse!

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        I've been living like this for a long time – about twenty years. I'm forty now. I used to be
        in the civil service; I no longer am. I was a wicked official. I was rude, and took pleasure
        in it. After all, I didn't accept bribes, so I had to reward myself
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        at least with that. (A bad witticism, but I won't cross it out. I wrote it thinking it would
        come out very witty; but now, seeing for myself that I simply had a vile wish to swagger – I
        purposely won't cross it out!) When petitioners would come for information to the desk where
        I sat – I'd gnash my teeth at them, and felt an inexhaustible delight when I managed to
        upset someone. I almost always managed. They were timid people for the most part:
        petitioners, you know. But among the fops there was one officer I especially could not
        stand. He simply refused to submit and kept rattling his sabre disgustingly. I was at war
        with him over that sabre for a year and a half. In the end, I prevailed. He stopped
        rattling. However, that was still in my youth. But do you know, gentlemen, what was the main
        point about my wickedness? The whole thing precisely was, the greatest nastiness precisely
        lay in my being shamefully conscious every moment, even in moments of the greatest bile,
        that I was not only not a wicked but was not even an embittered man, that I was simply
        frightening sparrows in vain, and pleasing myself with it. I'm foaming at the mouth, but
        bring me some little doll, give me some tea with a bit of sugar, and maybe I'll calm down.
        I'll even wax tenderhearted, though afterwards I'll certainly gnash my teeth at myself and
        suffer from insomnia for a few months out of shame. Such is my custom.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        And I lied about myself just now when I said I was a wicked official. I lied out of
        wickedness. I was simply playing around both with the petitioners and with the officer, but
        as a matter of fact I was never able to become wicked. I was conscious every moment of so
        very many elements in myself most opposite to that. I felt them simply swarming in me, those
        opposite elements. I knew they had been swarming in me all my life, asking to be let go out
        of me, but I would not let them, I would not, I purposely would not let them out. They
        tormented me to the point of shame; they drove me to convulsions, and – finally I got sick
        of them, oh, how sick I got! But do you not perhaps think, gentlemen, that I am now
        repenting of something before you, that I am asking your forgiveness for something? . . .
        I'm sure you think so . . . However, I assure you that it is all the same to me even if you
        do . . .

        Not just wicked, no, I never even managed to become anything: neither wicked nor good,
        neither a scoundrel nor an honest man, neither a hero nor an insect. And now I am living out
        my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and utterly futile consolation that
        it is even impossible for an intelligent man seriously to become anything, and only fools
        become something. Yes, sir, an intelligent man of the nineteenth century must be and is
        morally obliged to be primarily a characterless being; and a man of character, an active
        figure – primarily a limited being. This is my forty-year-old conviction. I am now forty
        years old, and, after all, forty years – is a whole lifetime; after all, it's the most
        extreme old age. To live beyond forty is indecent, banal, immoral! Who lives beyond forty –
        answer me sincerely, honestly? I'll tell you who does: fools and scoundrels do. I'll say it
        in the faces of all the elders, all these venerable elders, all these silver-haired and
        sweet-smelling elders! I'll say it in the whole world's face! I have the right to speak this
        way, because I myself will live to be sixty. I'll live to be seventy! I'll live to be
        eighty! . . . Wait! let me catch my breath . . .

        You no doubt think, gentlemen, that I want to make you laugh? Here, too, you're mistaken. I
        am not at all such a jolly man as you think, or as you possibly think; if, however,
        irritated by all this chatter (and I already feel you are irritated), you decide to ask me:
        what precisely am I? – then I will answer you: I am one collegiate assessor.

        I served so as to have something to eat (but solely for that), and when last year one of my
        distant relations left me six thousand roubles in his will, I resigned at once and settled
        into my corner. I lived in this corner before as well, but now I've settled into it. My room
        is wretched, bad, on the edge of the city. My servant is a village woman, old, wicked from
        stupidity, and always bad-smelling besides. I'm told that the Petersburg climate is
        beginning to do me harm, and that with my negligible means life in Petersburg is very
        expensive. I know all that, I know it better than all these experienced and most wise
        counsellors and waggers of heads.
      </span>

      

      <span class="calibre13">
        But I am staying in Petersburg; I will not leave Petersburg! I will not leave because . . .
        Eh! but it's all completely the same whether I leave or not.

        I would now like to tell you, gentlemen, whether you do or do not wish to hear it, why I
        never managed to become even an insect. I'll tell you solemnly that I wanted many times to
        become an insect. But I was not deemed worthy even of that. I swear to you, gentlemen, that
        to be overly conscious is a sickness, a real, thorough sickness. For man's everyday use,
        ordinary human consciousness would be more than enough; that is, a half, a quarter of the
        portion that falls to the lot of a developed man in our unfortunate nineteenth century, who,
        on top of that, has the added misfortune of residing in Petersburg, the most abstract and
        intentional city on the entire globe. (Cities can be intentional or unintentional.) As much
        consciousness, for example, as that by which all so-called ingenuous people and active
        figures live would be quite enough. I'll bet you think I'm writing all this out of swagger,
        to be witty at the expense of active figures, and swagger of a bad tone besides, rattling my
        sabre like my officer. But, gentlemen, who can take pride in his sicknesses, and swagger
        about them besides?

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        Though – what am I saying? – everyone does it; it's their sicknesses that everyone takes
        pride in, and I, perhaps, more than anyone. Let us not argue; my objection was absurd. But
        all the same I am strongly convinced that not only too much consciousness but even any
        consciousness at all is a sickness. I stand upon it. But let us also leave that for a
        moment. Tell me this: why was it that, as if by design, in those same, yes, in those very
        same moments when I was most capable of being conscious of all the refinements of
        “everything beautiful and lofty,”
      </span>


      <span class="calibre13">
        as we once used to say, it happened that instead of being conscious I did such unseemly
        deeds, such deeds as . . . well, in short, as everyone does, perhaps, but which with me
        occurred, as if by design, precisely when I was most conscious that I ought not to be doing
        them at all? The more conscious I was of the good and of all this “beautiful and lofty,” the
        deeper I kept sinking into my mire, and the more capable I was of getting completely stuck
        in it. But the main feature was that this was all in me not as if by chance, but as if it
        had to be so. As if it were my most normal condition and in no way a sickness or a blight,
        so that finally I lost any wish to struggle against this blight. I ended up almost believing
        (and maybe indeed believing) that this perhaps was my normal condition. But at first, in the
        beginning, how much torment I endured in this struggle! I did not believe that such things
        happened to others, and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret. I was ashamed
        (maybe I am ashamed even now); it reached the point with me where I would feel some secret,
        abnormal, mean little pleasure in returning to my corner on some most nasty Petersburg night
        and being highly conscious of having once again done a nasty thing that day, and again that
        what had been done could in no way be undone, and I would gnaw, gnaw at myself with my
        teeth, inwardly, secretly, tear and suck at myself until the bitterness finally turned into
        some shameful, accursed sweetness, and finally – into a decided, serious pleasure! Yes, a
        pleasure, a pleasure! I stand upon it. The reason I've begun to speak is that I keep wanting
        to find out for certain: do other people have such pleasures? I'll explain to you: the
        pleasure here lay precisely in the too vivid consciousness of one's own humiliation; in
        feeling that one had reached the ultimate wall; that, bad as it is, it cannot be otherwise;
        that there is no way out for you, that you will never change into a different person; that
        even if you had enough time and faith left to change yourself into something different, you
        probably would not wish to change; and even if you did wish it, you would still not do
        anything, because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change into. And chiefly, and finally,
        all this occurs according to the normal and basic laws of heightened consciousness and the
        inertia that follows directly from these laws, and consequently there is not only nothing
        you can do to change yourself, but there is simply nothing to do at all. So it turns out,
        for example, as a result of heightened consciousness: right, you're a scoundrel – as if it
        were a consolation for the scoundrel himself to feel that he is indeed a scoundrel. But
        enough . . . Eh, I've poured all that out, and what have I explained? . . . How explain this
        pleasure? But I will explain myself! I will carry through to the end! That is why I took a
        pen in my hands . . .

        I have, for example, a terrible amour propre. I am as insecure and touchy as a hunchback or
        a dwarf, yet there have indeed been moments when if I had happened to be slapped, I might
        even have been glad of it. I say it seriously: surely I'd have managed to discover some sort
        of pleasure in that as well – the pleasure of despair, of course, but it is in despair that
        the most burning pleasures occur, especially when one is all too highly conscious of the
        hopelessness of one's position. And here, with this slap – you'll simply be crushed by the
        consciousness of what sort of slime you've been reduced to. But chiefly, however you
        shuffle, it still comes out that I always come out as the first to blame for everything and,
        what's most offensive, blamelessly to blame, according to the laws of nature, so to speak.
        I'm to blame, first, because I'm more intelligent than everyone around me. (I've always
        considered myself more intelligent than everyone around me, and, would you believe, have
        even felt slightly ashamed of it. At least I've somehow averted my eyes all my life, and
        never could look people straight in the face.) I'm to blame, finally, because even if there
        were any magnanimity in me, I would be the one most tormented by the consciousness of its
        utter futility. For I would surely be able to do nothing with my magnanimity: neither to
        forgive, because my offender might have hit me according to the laws of nature, and the laws
        of nature cannot be forgiven; nor to forget, because even though it's the laws of nature,
        it's still offensive. Finally, even if I should want to be altogether unmagnanimous, if, on
        the contrary, I should wish to take revenge on my offender, I wouldn't be able to take
        revenge on anyone in any way, because I surely wouldn't dare to do anything even if I could.
        Why wouldn't I dare? About that I would like to say a couple of words in particular.

      <span class="calibre13">
        What happens, for example, with people who know how to take revenge and generally how to
        stand up for themselves? Once they are overcome, say, by vengeful feeling, then for the time
        there is simply nothing left in their whole being but this feeling. Such a gentleman just
        lunges straight for his goal like an enraged bull, horns lowered, and maybe only a wall can
        stop him. (Incidentally: before a wall, these gentlemen – that is, ingenuous people and
        active figures – quite sincerely fold. For them a wall is not a deflection, as it is, for
        example, for us, people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not a pretext for
        turning back, a pretext which our sort usually doesn't believe in but is always very glad to
        have. No, they fold in all sincerity. For them a wall possesses something soothing, morally
        resolving and final, perhaps even something mystical . . . But of the wall later.) Well,
        sirs, it is just such an ingenuous man that I regard as the real, normal man, the way his
        tender mother – nature – herself wished to see him when she so kindly conceived him on
        earth. I envy such a man to the point of extreme bile. He is stupid, I won't argue with you
        about that, but perhaps a normal man ought to be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it's even
        very beautiful. And I am the more convinced of this, so to speak, suspicion, seeing that if,
        for example, one takes the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of heightened
        consciousness, who came, of course, not from the bosom of nature but from a retort (this is
        almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect that, too), this retort man sometimes folds
        before his antithesis so far that he honestly regards himself, with all his heightened
        consciousness, as a mouse and not a man. A highly conscious mouse, perhaps, but a mouse all
        the same, whereas here we have a man, and consequently . . . and so on . . . And, above all,
        it is he, he himself, who regards himself as a mouse; no one asks him to; and that is an
        important point.

        Let us now have a look at this mouse in action. Suppose, for example, that it, too, is
        offended (and it is almost always offended), and it, too, wishes to take revenge. For it may
        have stored up even more spite than

        with his innate stupidity, regards his revenge quite simply as justice; whereas the mouse,
        as a result of its heightened consciousness, denies it any justice. Things finally come down
        to the business itself, to the act of revenge itself. The wretched mouse, in addition to the
        one original nastiness, has already managed to fence itself about with so many other
        nastinesses in the form of questions and doubts; it has padded out the one question with so
        many unresolved questions that, willy-nilly, some fatal slops have accumulated around it,
        some stinking filth consisting of its dubieties, anxieties, and, finally, of the spit
        raining on it from the ingenuous figures who stand solemnly around it like judges and
        dictators, guffawing at it from all their healthy gullets. Of course, nothing remains for it
        but to wave the whole thing aside with its little paw and, with a smile of feigned contempt,
        in which it does not believe itself, slip back shamefacedly into its crack. There, in its
        loathsome, stinking underground, our offended, beaten-down, and derided mouse at once
        immerses itself in cold, venomous, and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years on end
        it will recall its offense to the last, most shameful details, each time adding even more
        shameful details of its own, spitefully taunting and chafing itself with its fantasies. It
        will be ashamed of its fantasies, but all the same it will recall everything, go over
        everything, heap all sorts of figments on itself, under the pretext that they, too, could
        have happened, and forgive nothing. It may even begin to take revenge, but somehow in
        snatches, with piddling things, from behind the stove, incognito, believing neither in its
        right to revenge itself nor in the success of its vengeance, and knowing beforehand that it
        will suffer a hundred times more from all its attempts at revenge than will the object of
        its vengeance, who will perhaps not even scratch at the bite. On its deathbed it will again
        recall everything, adding the interest accumulated over all that time, and . . . But it is
        precisely in this cold, loathsome half-despair, half-belief, in this conscious burying
        oneself alive from grief for forty years in the underground, in this assiduously produced
        and yet somewhat dubious hopelessness of one's position, in all this poison of unsatisfied
        desires penetrating inward, in all this fever of hesitations, of decisions taken forever,
        and repentances coming again a moment later, that the very sap of that strange pleasure I
        was talking about consists. It is so subtle, sometimes so elusive of consciousness, that
        people who are even the slightest bit narrow-minded, or who simply have strong nerves, will
        not understand a single trace of it.”Perhaps,” you will add, grinning, “those who have never
        been slapped will also not understand” – thereby politely hinting that I, too, may have
        experienced a slap in my life, and am therefore speaking as a connoisseur. I'll bet that's
        what you think. But calm yourselves, gentlemen, I have not received any slaps, though it's
        all quite the same to me whatever you may think about it. Perhaps I myself am sorry for
        having dealt out too few slaps in my life. But enough, not another word on this subject
        which you find so extremely interesting.

        I calmly continue about people with strong nerves, who do not understand a certain
        refinement of pleasure. In the face of some mishaps, for example, these gentlemen may bellow
        at the top of their lungs like bulls, and let's suppose this brings them the greatest honor,
        but still, as I've already said, they instantly resign themselves before impossibility.
        Impossibility – meaning a stone wall? What stone wall? Well, of course, the laws of nature,
        the conclusions of natural science, mathematics. Once it's proved to you, for example, that
        you descended from an ape, there's no use making a wry face, just take it for what it is.
        Once it's proved to you that, essentially speaking, one little drop of your own fat should
        be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow men, and that in this result all
        so-called virtues and obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved,
        go ahead and accept it, there's nothing to be done, because two times two is – mathematics.

        “For pity's sake,” they'll shout at you, “you can't rebel: it's two times two is four!
        Nature doesn't ask your permission; it doesn't care about your wishes, or whether you like
        its laws or not. You're obliged to accept it as it is, and consequently all its results as
        well. And so a wall is indeed a wall . . . etc., etc.” My God, but what do I care about the
        laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are
        not to my liking? To be sure, I won't break through such a wall with my forehead if I really
        have not got strength enough to do it, but neither will I be reconciled with it simply
        because I have a stone wall here and have not got strength enough.

        As if such a stone wall were truly soothing and truly contained in itself at least some word

        another thing is to understand all, to be conscious of all, all impossibilities and stone
        walls; not to be reconciled with a single one of these impossibilities and stone walls if
        you are loath to be reconciled; to reach, by way of the most inevitable logical
        combinations, the most revolting conclusions on the eternal theme that you yourself seem
        somehow to blame even for the stone wall, though once again it is obviously clear that you
        are in no way to blame; and in consequence of that, silently and impotently gnashing your
        teeth, to come to a voluptuous standstill in inertia, fancying that, as it turns out, there
        isn't even anyone to be angry with; that there is no object to be found, and maybe never
        will be; that it's all a sleight-of-hand, a stacked deck, a cheat, that it's all just slops

        Ha, ha, ha! Next you'll be finding pleasure in a toothache!” you will exclaim, laughing.”And
        why not? There is also pleasure in a toothache,” I will answer. I had a toothache for a
        whole month; I know there is. Here, of course, one does not remain silently angry, one
        moans; but these are not straightforward moans, they are crafty moans, and the craftiness is
        the whole point. These moans express the pleasure of the one who is suffering; if they did
        not give him pleasure, he wouldn't bother moaning. It's a good example, gentlemen, and I
        shall develop it. In these moans there is expressed, first, all the futility of our pain, so
        humiliating for our consciousness, and all the lawfulness of nature, on which, to be sure,
        you spit, but from which you suffer all the same, while it does not. There is expressed the
        consciousness that your enemy is nowhere to be found, and yet there is pain; the
        consciousness that, despite all possible Wagenheims,
      </span>

   

      <span class="calibre13">
        you are wholly the slave of your teeth; that if someone wishes, your teeth will stop aching,
        and if not, they will go on aching for another three months; and that, finally, if you still
        do not agree, and protest even so, then the only consolation you have left is to whip
        yourself, or give your wall a painful beating with your fist, and decidedly nothing else.
        Well, sir, it is with these bloody offenses, with these mockeries from no one knows whom,
        that the pleasure finally begins, sometimes reaching the highest sensuality. I ask you,
        gentlemen: listen sometime to the moaning of an educated man of the nineteenth century who
        is suffering from a toothache – say, on the second or third day of his ailment, when he's
        beginning to moan not as he did on the first day, that is, not simply because he has a
        toothache, not like some coarse peasant, but like a man touched by development and European
        civilization, like a man who has “renounced the soil and popular roots,” as they say
        nowadays.
      </span>

    

      <span class="calibre13">
        His moans somehow turn bad, nastily wicked, and continue for whole days and nights. Yet he
        himself knows that his moans will be of no use to him; he knows better than anyone that he
        is only straining and irritating himself and others in vain; he knows that even the public
        before whom he is exerting himself, and his whole family, are already listening to him with
        loathing, do not believe even a pennyworth of it, and understand in themselves that he could
        moan differently, more simply, without roulades and flourishes, and that it's just from
        spite and craftiness that he is playing around like that. Now, it is in all these
        consciousnesses and disgraces that the sensuality consists.”So I'm bothering you, straining
        your hearts, not letting anyone in the house sleep. Don't sleep, then; you, too, should feel
        every moment that I have a toothache. For you I'm no longer a hero, as I once wished to
        appear, but simply a vile little fellow, a

        you . . .” You still don't understand, gentlemen? No, evidently one must attain a profundity
        of development and consciousness to understand all the curves of this sensuality! You're

        No, how is it possible, how is it at all possible for a man to have the slightest respect
        for himself, if he has presumed to find pleasure even in the very sense of his own
        humiliation? I am not speaking this way now out of some cloying repentance. And, generally,
        I hated saying: “Forgive me, papa, I won't do it again” – not because I was incapable of
        saying it, but, on the contrary, perhaps precisely because I was all too capable of it. And
        how! As if on purpose, I used to bumble into it on occasions when I'd never thought or
        dreamed of doing anything wrong. That was the nastiest thing of all. And there I'd be again,
        waxing tenderhearted, repenting, shedding tears, and certainly hoodwinking myself, though I
        wasn't pretending in the least. It was my heart that somehow kept mucking things up . . .
        Here even the laws of nature could no longer be blamed, though still, throughout my life,
        the laws of nature have offended me constantly and more than anything else. It's nasty to
        look back on it all, and it was nasty then as well. For a minute or so later I'd be
        reasoning spitefully that it was all a lie, a lie, a loathsome, affected lie – that is, all
        these repentances, tenderheartednesses, all these vows of regeneration. And you ask why I
        twisted and tormented myself so? Answer: because it was just too boring to sit there with
        folded arms, that's why I'd get into such flourishes. Really, it was so. Observe yourselves
        more closely, gentlemen, and you'll understand that it is so. I made up adventures and
        devised a life for myself so as to live, at least somehow, a little. How many times it
        happened to me – well, say, for example, to feel offended, just so, for no reason, on
        purpose; and I'd know very well that I felt offended for no reason, that I was affecting it,
        but you can drive yourself so far that in the end, really, you do indeed get offended.
        Somehow all my life I've had an urge to pull such stunts, so that in the end I could no
        longer control myself. Another time, twice even, I decided to force myself to fall in love.
        And I did suffer, gentlemen, I assure you. Deep in one's soul it's hard to believe one is
        suffering, mockery is stirring there, but all the same I suffer, and in a real,
        honest-to-god way; I get jealous, lose my temper . . . And all that from boredom, gentlemen,
        all from boredom; crushed by inertia. For the direct, lawful, immediate fruit of
        consciousness is inertia – that is, a conscious sitting with folded arms. I've already
        mentioned this above. I repeat, I emphatically repeat: ingenuous people and active figures
        are all active simply because they are dull and narrow-minded. How to explain it? Here's
        how: as a consequence of their narrow-mindedness, they take the most immediate and secondary
        causes for the primary ones, and thus become convinced more quickly and easily than others
        that they have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel at ease; and
        that, after all, is the main thing. For in order to begin to act, one must first be
        completely at ease, so that no more doubts remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set
        myself at ease? Where are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where
        am I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me every primary cause
        immediately drags with it yet another, still more primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such
        is precisely the essence of all consciousness and thought. So, once again it's the laws of
        nature. And what, finally, is the result? The same old thing. Remember: I was speaking just
        now about revenge. (You probably didn't grasp it.) I said: a man takes revenge because he
        finds justice in it. That means he has found a primary cause, a basis – namely, justice. So
        he is set at ease on all sides and, consequently, takes his revenge calmly and successfully,
        being convinced that he is doing an honest and just thing. Whereas I do not see any justice
        here, nor do I find any virtue in it, and, consequently, if I set about taking revenge, it
        will be solely out of wickedness. Wickedness could, of course, overcome everything, all my
        doubts, and thus could serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely in
        that it is not a cause. But what's to be done if there is also no wickedness in me? (I did
        begin with that just now.) The spite in me, again as a consequence of those cursed laws of
        consciousness, undergoes a chemical breakdown. Before your eyes the object vanishes, the
        reasons evaporate, the culprit is not to be found, the offense becomes not an offense but a
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        <span class="italic"> fatum, </span>
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        something like a toothache, for which no one is to blame, and, consequently, what remains is
        again the same way out – that is, to give the wall a painful beating. And so you just wave
        it aside, because you haven't found the primary cause. But try getting blindly carried away
        by your feelings, without reasoning, without a primary cause, driving consciousness away at
        least for a time; start hating, or fall in love, only so as not to sit with folded arms. The
        day after tomorrow, at the very latest, you'll begin to despise yourself for having
        knowingly hoodwinked yourself. The result: a soap bubble, and inertia. Oh, gentlemen,
        perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life
        I've never been able to start or finish anything. Granted, granted I'm a babbler, a
        harmless, irksome babbler, as we all are. But what's to be done if the sole and express
        purpose of every intelligent man is babble – that is, a deliberate pouring from empty into
        void.

        Oh, if I were doing nothing only out of laziness. Lord, how I'd respect myself then. Respect
        myself precisely because I'd at least be capable of having laziness in me; there would be in
        me at least one, as it were, positive quality, which I myself could be sure of. Question:
        who is he? Answer: a lazybones. Now, it would be most agreeable to hear that about myself.
        It means I'm positively defined; it means there's something to say about me.”Lazybones!” –
        now, that is a title and a mission, it's a career, sirs. No joking, it really is. By rights
        I'm then a member of the foremost club, and my sole occupation is ceaselessly respecting
        myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a fine judge of Lafite.
        He regarded it as his positive merit and never doubted himself. He died not merely with a
        serene but with a triumphant conscience, and he was perfectly right. And so I would choose a
        career for myself: I would be a lazybones and a glutton, and not just an ordinary one, but,
        for example, one sympathizing with everything beautiful and lofty. How do you like that?
        I've long been fancying it. This “beautiful and lofty” has indeed weighed heavy on my head

        forty years, while then – oh, then it would be different! I would at once find an
        appropriate activity for myself – namely, drinking the health of all that is beautiful and
        lofty. I would seize every occasion, first to shed a tear into my glass, and then to drink
        it for all that is beautiful and lofty. I would then turn everything in the world into the
        beautiful and lofty; in the vilest, most unquestionable trash I would discover the beautiful
        and lofty. I'd become as tearful as a sodden sponge. An artist, for example, has painted a

        he to be enlightened, were his eyes to be opened to his real, normal interests, man would
        immediately stop doing dirty, would immediately become good and noble, because, being
        enlightened and understanding his real profit, he would see his real profit precisely in the
        good, and it's common knowledge that no man can act knowingly against his own profit,
        consequently, out of necessity, so to speak, he would start doing good? Oh, the babe! Oh,
        the pure, innocent child! And when was it, to begin with, in all these thousands of years,

        that is, fully understanding their real profit, would put it in second place and throw

        pushed off onto another one, difficult, absurd, searching for it all but in the dark. So,
        then, this stubbornness and willfulness were really more agreeable to them than any profit .

        <span class="italic"> on occasion </span>
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        man's profit not only may but precisely must consist in sometimes wishing what is bad for
        himself, and not what is profitable? And if so, if there can be such a case, then the whole
        rule goes up in smoke. What do you think, can such a case occur? You're laughing; laugh
        then, gentlemen, only answer me: has man's profit been calculated quite correctly? Isn't
        there something that not only has not been but even cannot be fitted into any
        classification? Because, gentlemen, as far as I know, you have taken your whole inventory of
        human profits from an average of statistical figures and scientifico-economic formulas.
        Because profit for you is prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace, and so on and so forth; so
        that a man who, for example, openly and knowingly went against this whole inventory would,
        in your opinion – well, and also in mine, of course – be an obscurantist or a complete
        madman, right? But here is the surprising thing: how does it happen that all these
        statisticians, sages, and lovers of mankind, in calculating human profits, constantly omit
        one profit? They don't even take it into account in the way it ought to be taken, and yet
        the whole account depends on that. It's no great trouble just to take it, this profit, and
        include it in the list. But that's the whole bane of it, that this tricky profit doesn't
        fall into any classification, doesn't fit into any list. I, for instance, have a friend . .
        . Eh, gentlemen! but he's your friend as well; and whose friend is he not! Preparing to do
        something, this gentleman will at once expound to you, with great eloquence and clarity,
        precisely how he must needs act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth. Moreover:
        with passion and excitement he will talk to you of real, normal human interests; with
        mockery he will reproach those shortsighted fools who understand neither their own profit
        nor the true meaning of virtue; and then, exactly a quarter of an hour later, without any
        sudden, extraneous cause, but precisely because of something within him that is stronger
        than all his interests, he'll cut quite a different caper, that is, go obviously against
        what he himself was just saying: against the laws of reason, against his own profit; well,
        in short, against everything . . . I warn you that my friend is a collective person, and
        therefore it is somehow difficult to blame him alone. That's just the thing, gentlemen, that
        there may well exist something that is dearer for almost every man than his very best
        profit, or (so as not to violate logic) that there is this one most profitable profit
        (precisely the omitted one, the one we were just talking about), which is chiefer and more
        profitable than all other profits, and for which a man is ready, if need be, to go against
        all laws, that is, against reason, honor, peace, prosperity – in short, against all these
        beautiful and useful things – only so as to attain this primary, most profitable profit
        which is dearer to him than anything else.

        “Well, but it is a profit, after all,” you will interrupt me. I beg your pardon, sirs, but
        we shall speak further of it, and the point is not in a play on words, but in the fact that
        this profit is remarkable precisely because it destroys all our classifications and
        constantly shatters all the systems elaborated by lovers of mankind for the happiness of
        mankind. Interferes with everything, in short. But before naming this profit for you, I want
        to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these beautiful
        systems, all these theories that explain to mankind its true, normal interests, so that,
        striving necessarily to attain these interests, it would at once become good and noble – all
        this, in my opinion, is so far only logistics! Yes, sirs, logistics! For merely to assert
        this theory of the renewal of all mankind by means of a system of its own profits – this, to
        my mind, is almost the same as . . . well, let's say, for example, the same as asserting,
        with Buckle, that man gets softer from civilization and, consequently, becomes less

        What is it that civilization softens in us? Civilization cultivates only a versatility of
        sensations in man, and . . . decidedly nothing else. And through the development of this
        versatility, man may even reach the point of finding pleasure in blood. Indeed, this has
        already happened to him. Have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost
        all been the most civilized gentlemen, to whom the various Attilas and Stenka Razins
      </span>

    

      <span class="calibre13">
        sometimes could not hold a candle? And if they don't strike one as sharply as Attila or
        Stenka Razin, it is precisely because they occur too frequently, they are too ordinary, too
        familiar a sight. If man has not become more bloodthirsty from civilization, at any rate he
        has certainly become bloodthirsty in a worse, a viler way than formerly. Formerly, he saw
        justice in bloodshed and with a quiet conscience exterminated whoever he had to; while now,
        though we do regard bloodshed as vile, we still occupy ourselves with this vileness, and
        even more than formerly. Which is worse? — decide for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra
        (excuse this example from Roman history) liked to stick golden pins into her slave girls'
        breasts, and took pleasure in their screaming and writhing. You'll say that this was,
        relatively speaking, in barbarous times; that now, too, the times are barbarous because
        (again relatively speaking) now, too, pins get stuck in; that now, too, though man has
        learned to see more clearly on occasion than in barbarous times, he is still far from

      <span class="calibre13">
        to acting as reason and science dictate. But even so you are perfectly confident that he
        will not fail to grow accustomed once one or two old bad habits have passed and once common
        sense and science have thoroughly re-educated and given a normal direction to human nature.
        You are confident that man will then

      <span class="calibre13">
        cease making mistakes and, willy-nilly, so to speak, refuse to set his will at variance with
        his normal interests. Moreover: then, you say, science itself will teach man (though this is
        really a luxury in my opinion) that in fact he has neither will nor caprice, and never did
        have any, and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ;
      </span>

  

      <span class="calibre13">
        and that, furthermore, there also exist in the world the laws of nature; so that whatever he
        does is done not at all according to his own wanting, but of itself, according to the laws
        of nature. Consequently, these laws of nature need only be discovered, and then man will no
        longer be answerable for his actions, and his life will become extremely easy. Needless to
        say, all human actions will then be calculated according to these laws, mathematically, like
        a table of logarithms, up to 108,000, and entered into a calendar; or, better still, some
        well-meaning publications will appear, like the present-day encyclopaedic dictionaries, in
        which everything will be so precisely calculated and designated that there will no longer be
        any actions or adventures in the world.

        And it is then – this is still you speaking – that new economic relations will come, quite
        ready-made, and also calculated with mathematical precision, so that all possible questions
        will vanish in an instant, essentially because they will have been given all possible
        answers. Then the crystal palace will get built.

        Of course, there's no guaranteeing (this is me speaking now) that it won't, for example, be
        terribly boring then (because what is there to do if everything's calculated according to
        some little table?), but, on the other hand, it will all be extremely reasonable. Of course,
        what inventions can boredom not lead to! Golden pins also get stuck in from boredom, but all
        that would be nothing. The bad thing is (this is me speaking again) that, for all I know,
        they may be glad of the golden pins then. Man really is stupid, phenomenally stupid. That
        is, he's by no means stupid, but rather he's so ungrateful that it would be hard to find the
        likes of him. I, for example, would not be the least bit surprised if suddenly, out of the
        blue, amid the universal future reasonableness, some gentleman of ignoble, or, better, of
        retrograde and jeering physiognomy, should emerge, set his arms akimbo, and say to us all:
        “Well, gentlemen, why don't we reduce all this reasonableness to dust with one good kick,
        for the sole purpose of sending all these logarithms to the devil and living once more
        according to our own stupid will!” That would still be nothing, but what is offensive is
        that he'd be sure to find followers: that's how man is arranged. And all this for the
        emptiest of reasons, which would seem not even worth mentioning: namely, that man, whoever
        he might be, has always and everywhere liked to act as he wants, and not at all as reason
        and profit dictate; and one can want even against one's own profit, and one sometimes even

        (this is my idea now). One's own free and voluntary wanting, one's own caprice, however
        wild, one's own fancy, though chafed sometimes to the point of madness – all this is that
        same most profitable profit, the omitted one, which does not fit into any classification,
        and because of which all systems and theories are constantly blown to the devil. And where
        did all these sages get the idea that man needs some normal, some virtuous wanting? What
        made them necessarily imagine that what man needs is necessarily a reasonably profitable
        wanting? Man needs only

        Wait, gentlemen, I myself wanted to begin that way. I confess, I even got scared. I just
        wanted to cry out that wanting depends on the devil knows what, and thank God, perhaps, for
        that, but I remembered about this science and . . . backed off. And just then you started
        talking. And indeed, well, if one day they really find the formula for all our wantings and
        caprices – that is, what they depend on, by precisely what laws they occur, precisely how
        they spread, what they strive for in such-and-such a case, and so on and so forth; a real,
        mathematical formula, that is – then perhaps man will immediately stop wanting; what's more,
        perhaps he will certainly stop. Who wants to want according to a little table? Moreover: he
        will immediately turn from a man into a sprig in an organ or something of the sort; because
        what is man without desires, without will, and without wantings, if not a sprig in an organ
        barrel? What do you think? – let's reckon up the probabilities – can it happen or not?

      <span class="calibre13">
        “Hm . . .” you decide, “our wantings are for the most part mistaken owing to a mistaken view
        of our profit. We sometimes want pure rubbish precisely because, in our stupidity, we see
        this rubbish as the easiest path to the attainment of some preconceived profit. Well, but
        when it's all explained, worked out on a piece of paper (which is quite possible because,
        after all, it's vile and senseless to believe beforehand that there are certain laws of
        nature which man will never learn) – then, to be sure, there will be no more so-called
        desires. For if wanting someday gets completely in cahoots with reason, then essentially we
        shall be reasoning and not wanting, because it really is impossible, for example, while
        preserving reason, to

        senselessness and thus knowingly go against reason and wish yourself harm . . . And since
        all wantings and reasonings can indeed be calculated – because, after all, they will someday
        discover the laws of our so-called free will – then consequently, and joking aside,
        something like a little table can be arranged, so that we shall indeed want according to
        this little table. For if it should someday be worked out and proved to me that when I made
        a fig at such-and-such a person, it was precisely because I could not do otherwise, and that
        I was bound to do it with such-and-such a finger, then what is left so

        No, then I can calculate my life for thirty years ahead; in short, if this does get
        arranged, then we really will have no choice; we'll have to accept it in any case. And,
        generally, we ought tirelessly to repeat to ourselves that, precisely at such-and-such a
        moment, in such-and-such circumstances, nature does not ask our permission; that it must be
        accepted as it is, and not as we fancy, and if we are really aiming at a little table and a
        calendar, and . . . well, and even at a retort, then there's no help for it, we must accept

        Yes, sirs, but for me that's just where the hitch comes! You will forgive me, gentlemen, for
        philosophizing away; it's a matter of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy
        a bit. You see: reason, gentlemen, is a fine thing, that is unquestionable, but reason is
        only reason and satisfies only man's reasoning capacity, while wanting is a manifestation of
        the whole of life – that is, the whole of human life, including reason and various little
        itches. And though our life in this manifestation often turns out to be a bit of trash,
        still it is life and not just the extraction of a square root. I, for example, quite
        naturally want to live so as to satisfy my whole capacity for living, and not so as to
        satisfy just my reasoning capacity alone, which is some twentieth part of my whole capacity
        for living. What does reason know? Reason knows only what it has managed to learn (some
        things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is no consolation, but why not say it anyway?),
        while human nature acts as an entire whole, with everything that is in it, consciously and
        unconsciously, and though it lies, still it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are
        looking at me with pity; you repeat to me that an enlightened and developed man, such, in
        short, as the future man will be, simply cannot knowingly want anything unprofitable for
        himself, that this is mathematics. I agree completely, it is indeed mathematics. But I
        repeat to you for the hundredth time, there is only one case, one only, when man may
        purposely, consciously wish for himself even the harmful, the stupid, even what is stupidest
        of all: namely, so as
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        <span class="italic"> to have the right </span>
      </span>

      <span class="calibre13">
        to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all and not be bound by an obligation to wish
        for himself only what is intelligent. For this stupidest of all, this caprice of ours,
        gentlemen, may in fact be the most profitable of anything on earth for our sort, especially
        in certain cases. And in particular it may be more profitable than all other profits even in
        the case when it is obviously harmful and contradicts the most sensible conclusions of our
        reason concerning profits – because in any event it preserves for us the chiefest and
        dearest thing, that is, our personality and our individuality. Now, some insist that this is
        indeed the dearest of all things for man; wanting may, of course, converge with reason, if
        it wants, especially if this is not abused but is done with moderation; it is both useful
        and sometimes even praiseworthy. But wanting is very often, and even for the most part,
        completely and stubbornly at odds with reason, and . . . and . . . and, do you know, this,
        too, is useful and sometimes even quite praiseworthy? Suppose, gentlemen, that man is not
        stupid. (Really, it is quite impossible to say he is, for the sole reason that if he is
        stupid, who then is intelligent?) But even if he isn't stupid, all the same he's monstrously
        ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. I even think the best definition of man is: a being
        that goes on two legs and is ungrateful. But that's still not all; that's still not his
        chief defect; his chiefest defect is his constant lack of good behavior – constant from the
        great flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period of man's destiny. Lack of good behavior and,
        consequently, lack of good sense; for it has long been known that lack of good sense comes
        from nothing else but the lack of good behavior. Try casting a glance at the history of
        mankind; well, what will you see? Majestic? Maybe it is majestic; the Colossus of Rhodes
        alone, for example, is worth something! Not without reason did Mr Anaevsky
      </span>


      <span class="calibre13">
        testify that while some say it was the work of human hands, others insist it was created by
        nature itself. Colorful? Maybe it is colorful; one need only sort through the full-dress
        military and civil uniforms of all times and all peoples – that alone is worth something,
        and if you were to add the uniforms of the lower civil ranks, you could really break a leg;
        no historian would be left standing. Monotonous? Well, maybe also monotonous: they fight and
        fight, they fight now, and fought before, and fought afterwards – you'll agree it's even all
        too monotonous. In short, anything can be said about world history, anything that might just
        enter the head of the most disturbed imagination. Only one thing cannot be said – that it is
        sensible. You'd choke on the first word. And one even comes upon this sort of thing all the
        time: there constantly appear in life people of such good behavior and good sense, such
        sages and lovers of mankind, as precisely make it their goal to spend their entire lives in
        the best-behaved and most sensible way possible, to become, so to speak, a light for their
        neighbors, essentially in order to prove to them that one can indeed live in the world as a
        person of good behavior and good sense. And what then? It is known that sooner or later,
        towards the end of their lives, many of these lovers have betrayed themselves, producing
        some anecdote, sometimes even of the most indecent sort. Now I ask you: what can be expected
        of man as a being endowed with such strange qualities? Shower him with all earthly
        blessings, drown him in happiness completely, over his head, so that only bubbles pop up on
        the surface of happiness, as on water; give him such economic satisfaction that he no longer
        has anything left to do at all except sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry about the
        noncessation of world history – and it is here, just here, that he, this man, out of sheer
        ingratitude, out of sheer lampoonery, will do something nasty. He will even risk his
        gingerbread, and wish on purpose for the most pernicious nonsense, the most noneconomical
        meaninglessness, solely in order to mix into all this positive good sense his own
        pernicious, fantastical element. It is precisely his fantastic dreams, his most banal
        stupidity, that he will wish to keep hold of, with the sole purpose of confirming to himself
        (as if it were so very necessary) that human beings are still human beings and not piano
        keys, which, though played upon with their own hands by the laws of nature themselves, are
        in danger of being played so much that outside the calendar it will be impossible to want
        anything. And more than that: even if it should indeed turn out that he is a piano key, if
        it were even proved to him mathematically and by natural science, he would still not come to
        reason, but would do something contrary on purpose, solely out of ingratitude alone;
        essentially to have his own way. And if he finds himself without means – he will invent
        destruction and chaos, he will invent all kinds of suffering, and still have his own way! He
        will launch a curse upon the world, and since man alone is able to curse (that being his
        privilege, which chiefly distinguishes him from other animals), he may achieve his end by
        the curse alone – that is, indeed satisfy himself that he is a man and not a piano key! If
        you say that all this, the chaos and darkness and cursing, can also be calculated according
        to a little table, so that the mere possibility of a prior calculation will put a stop to it
        all and reason will claim its own – then he will deliberately go mad for the occasion, so as
        to do without reason and still have his own way! I believe in this, I will answer for this,
        because the whole human enterprise seems indeed to consist in man's proving to himself every
        moment that he is a man and not a sprig! With his own skin if need be, but proving it; by
        troglodytism if need be, but proving it. And how not sin after that, how not boast that this
        has still not come about, and that wanting so far still depends on the devil knows what . .

        such as ants, sheep, and so on and so forth. Now, ants have totally different tastes. They
        have a remarkable edifice of the same sort, forever indestructible – the anthill.

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        With the anthill the most reverend ants began, and with the anthill they will doubtless end
        as well, which does great credit to their constancy and positiveness. But man is a frivolous
        and unseemly being, and perhaps, similar to a chess player, likes only the process of
        achieving the goal, but not the goal itself. And who knows (one cannot vouch for it),
        perhaps the whole goal mankind strives for on earth consists just in this cease-lessness of
        the process of achievement alone, that is to say, in life itself, and not essentially in the
        goal, which, of course, is bound to be nothing other than two times two is four – that is, a
        formula; and two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.
        At least man has always somehow feared this two times two is four, and I fear it even now.
        Suppose all man ever does is search for this two times two is four; he crosses oceans, he
        sacrifices his life in the search; but to search it out, actually to find it – by God, he's
        somehow afraid. For he senses that once he finds it, there will be nothing to search for.
        Workers, when they're done working, at least get their pay, go to a pot-house, then wind up
        with the police – so it keeps them busy for a week. But where is man to go? Something
        awkward, at any rate, can be noticed in him each time he achieves some such goal. Achieving
        he likes, but having achieved he does not quite like, and that, of course, is terribly
        funny. In short, man is comically arranged; there is apparently a joke in all this. But
        still, two times two is four is a most obnoxious thing. Two times two is four – why, in my
        opinion, it's sheer impudence, sirs. Two times two is four has a cocky look; it stands
        across your path, arms akimbo, and spits. I agree that two times two is four is an excellent
        thing; but if we're going to start praising everything, then two times two is five is
        sometimes also a most charming little thing.

        And why are you so firmly, so solemnly convinced that only the normal and the positive, in
        short, that only well-being, is profitable for man? Is reason not perhaps mistaken as to
        profits? Maybe man does not love well-being only? Maybe he loves suffering just as much?
        Maybe suffering is just as profitable for him as well-being? For man sometimes loves
        suffering terribly much, to the point of passion, and that is a fact. Here there's not even
        any need to consult world history; just ask yourself, if you're a human being and have had
        any life at all. As for my personal opinion, to love just well-being alone is even somehow
        indecent. Whether it's good or bad, it's sometimes also very pleasant to break something. I,
        as a matter of fact, take my stand here neither with suffering nor with well-being. I stand
        . . . for my own caprice, and that it be guaranteed me when necessary. Suffering, for
        example, is inadmissible in vaudevilles, I know that. In a crystal palace it is even
        unthinkable: suffering is doubt, it is negation, and what good is a crystal palace in which
        one can have doubts? And yet I'm certain that man will never renounce real suffering, that
        is, destruction and chaos. Suffering – why, this is the sole cause of consciousness. Though
        I did declare at the beginning that consciousness, in my opinion, is man's greatest
        misfortune, still I know that man loves it and will not exchange it for any satisfactions.
        Consciousness, for example, is infinitely higher than two times two. After two times two
        there would, of course, be nothing left – not only to do, but even to learn. The only
        possible thing to do then would be to stop up our five senses and immerse ourselves in
        contemplation. Well, but with consciousness, though the result comes out the same – that is,
        again there's nothing to do – at least one can occasionally whip oneself, and, after all,
        that livens things up a bit. It may be retrograde, but still it's better than nothing.

        angry simply because such an edifice, at which it is possible not to put out one's tongue,
        has never yet been found among all your edifices. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be

        you are not afraid of anything, and at the same time you court our opinion. You insist that

        respect for your suffering. There is truth in you, too, but no integrity; out of the
        pettiest vanity you take your truth and display it, disgrace it, in the marketplace . . .
        You do indeed want to say something, but you conceal your final word out of fear, because
        you lack the resolve to speak it out, you have only cowardly insolence. You boast about
        consciousness, yet all you do is vacillate, because, though your mind works, your heart is

        In every man's memories there are such things as he will reveal not to everyone, but perhaps
        only to friends. There are also such as he will reveal not even to friends, but only to
        himself, and that in secret. Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even
        to himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort. That
        is, one might even say: the more decent a man is, the more of them he will have. At least I
        myself have only recently resolved to recall some of my former adventures, which till now I
        have always avoided, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, however, when I not only recall
        them but am even resolved to write them down, now I want precisely to make a test: is it
        possible to be perfectly candid with oneself and not be afraid of the whole truth? I will
        observe incidentally: Heine insists that faithful autobiographies are almost impossible, and
        that a man is sure to tell a pack of lies about himself. In his opinion, Rousseau, for
        example, most certainly told a pack of lies about himself in his confessions, and even did
        so intentionally, out of vanity.
      </span>

      

      <span class="calibre13">
        I'm sure Heine is right; I understand very well how one can sometimes slap whole crimes on
        oneself solely out of vanity, and I even perceive quite well what sort of vanity it might
        be. But Heine's opinion concerned a man who was confessing before the public. I, however, am
        writing only for myself, and I declare once and for all that even if I write as if I were
        addressing readers, that is merely a front, because it's easier for me to write that way.
        It's a form, just an empty form, and I shall never have any readers. I have already declared
        as much . . .

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        I do not want to hamper myself with anything in preparing my notes. I will not introduce any
        order or system. Whatever I recall, I will write down.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        Now, for example, someone might seize upon a word and ask me: if you really are not counting
        on any readers, why then do you make such agreements with yourself, and on paper besides,
        that you will introduce no order or system, that you will write down whatever you recall,
        etc., etc.? Why these explanations? Why these apologies?

        There is, however, a whole psychology here. Maybe it's also that I'm simply a coward. And
        maybe also that I'm purposely imagining a public before me so as to behave more decently
        while I write. There may be a thousand reasons.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        But here is another thing: for what and to what end, in fact, do I want to write? If not for
        the public, then why not simply recall everything mentally, without transferring it to
        paper?
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        Right, sir; but on paper it will somehow come out more solemnly. There's something imposing
        in it, there will be more of a judgment on oneself, it will gain in style. Besides: maybe I
        will indeed get relief from the writing. Today, for example, I'm particularly oppressed by
        one distant recollection. I recalled it clearly the other day, and it has since stayed with
        me like a nagging musical tune that refuses to be gotten rid of. And yet one must get rid of
        it. I have hundreds of such recollections; but some one out of a hundred emerges every now
        and then and oppresses me. I believe for some reason that if I write it down, I shall then
        be rid of it. So why not try?
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre20">
      <span class="calibre13">
        Finally: I'm bored, and I constantly do nothing. And writing things down really seems like
        work. They say work makes a man good and honest. Well, here's a chance, at least.
