<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Although it is evidently visible, yet there is no one there who sees</i> <i class="calibre3">it</i>— <i class="calibre3">how amazing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Although it has wandered through samsara, no harm has come to</i> <i class="calibre3">it</i>— <i class="calibre3">how amazing. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Although it has seen buddhahood itself no good has come to it</i>— </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">how amazing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Although it exists in everyone everywhere, it has gone unrecognized</i>— <i class="calibre3">how amazing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And yet you go on hoping to attain some other fruit than this elsewhere</i>— <i class="calibre3">how amazing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Even though it is the thing that is most essentially yours, you seek</i> <i class="calibre3">for it elsewhere</i>— <i class="calibre3">how amazing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Why is it that this state is called "luminosity" or Clear Light? The masters have different ways of explaining this. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some say that it expresses the radiant clarity of the nature of mind, its total freedom from darkness or obscuration: "free from the darkness of unknowing and endowed with the ability to cognize." Another master describes the luminosity or Clear Light as "a state of minimum distraction," because all the elements, senses, and sense-objects are dissolved. What is important is not to confuse it with the physical light that we know, nor with the experiences of light that will unfold presently in the next bardo; the luminosity that arises at death is the natural radiance of the wisdom of our own Rigpa, "the uncompounded nature present throughout all of samsara and nirvana." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The dawning of the Ground Luminosity, or Clear Light, at the moment of death is <i class="calibre3"> the</i> great opportunity for liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But it is essential to realize on what terms this opportunity is given. Some modern writers and researchers on death have underestimated the profundity of this moment. Because they have read and interpreted the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> without the benefit of the oral instructions and training that fully THE GROUND 265 </p>
<p class="calibre2">explain its sacred meaning, they have oversimplified it and jumped to quick conclusions. One assumption they then make is that the dawning of the Ground Luminosity <i class="calibre3"> is</i> enlightenment. We might all like to identify death with heaven or enlightenment; but more important than mere wishful thinking is to know that only if we have really been introduced to the nature of our mind, our Rigpa, and only if we have established and stabilized it through meditation and integrated it into our life, does the moment of death offer a real opportunity for liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the Ground Luminosity presents itself naturally to us all, most of us are totally unprepared for its sheer immensity, the vast and subtle depth of its naked simplicity. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The majority of us will simply have no means of recognizing it, because we have not made ourselves familiar with ways of recognizing it in life. What happens, then, is that we tend to react instinctively with all our past fears, habits, and conditioning, all our old reflexes. Though the negative emotions may have died for the luminosity to appear, the habits of lifetimes still remain, hidden in the background of our ordinary mind. Though all our confusion dies in death, instead of surrendering and opening to the luminosity, in our fear and ignorance we withdraw and instinctively hold onto our grasping. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is what obstructs us from truly using this powerful moment as an opportunity for liberation. Padmasambhava says: "All beings have lived and died and been reborn countless times. Over and over again they have experienced the indescribable Clear Light. But because they are obscured by the darkness of ignorance, they wander endlessly in a limitless samsara." </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE GROUND OF THE ORDINARY MIND </p>
<p class="calibre2">All these habitual tendencies, the results of our negative karma, which have sprung from the darkness of ignorance, are stored in the ground of the ordinary mind. I have often wondered what would be a good example to help describe the ground of the ordinary mind. You could compare it to a transparent glass bubble, a very thin elastic film, an almost invisible barrier or veil that obscures the whole of our mind; but perhaps the most useful image I can think of is of a glass door. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine you are sitting in front of a glass door that leads out into your garden, looking through it, gazing out into space. It  seems as though there is nothing between you and the sky, because you cannot see the surface of the glass. You could even bang your nose if you got up and tried to walk through, thinking it wasn't there. But if you touch it you will see at once there is something there that holds your fingerprints, something that comes between you and the space outside. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the same manner, the ground of the ordinary mind prevents us from breaking through to the sky-like nature of our mind, even if we can still have glimpses of it. As I have said, the masters explain how there is a danger that meditation practitioners can mistake the experience of the ground of the ordinary mind for the real nature of mind itself. When they rest in a state of great calm and stillness, all they could be doing in fact might be merely resting in the ground of the ordinary mind. It is the difference between looking up at the sky from within a glass dome, and standing outside in the open air. We have to break out of the ground of the ordinary mind altogether, to discover and let in the fresh air of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So the aim of all our spiritual practice, and the real preparation for the moment of death, is to purify this subtle barrier, and gradually weaken it and break it down. When you have broken it down completely, nothing comes between you and the state of omniscience. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The introduction by the master to the nature of mind breaks through the ground of the ordinary mind altogether, as it is through this dissolution of the conceptual mind that the enlightened mind is explicitly revealed. Then, each time we rest in the nature of mind, the ground of the ordinary mind gets weaker. But we will notice that how long we can stay in the state of the nature of mind depends entirely on the stability of our practice. Unfortunately, "Old habits die hard," and the ground of the ordinary mind returns; our mind is like an alcoholic who can kick the habit for a while, but relapses whenever tempted or depressed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the glass door picks up all the traces of dirt from our hands and fingers, the ground of the ordinary mind gathers and stores all our karma and habits. And just as we have to keep wiping the glass, so we have to keep purifying the ground of the ordinary mind. It is as if the glass slowly wears away as it gets thinner and thinner, little holes appear, and it begins to dissolve. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Through our practice we gradually stabilize the nature of mind more and more, so that it does not simply remain as our absolute nature but becomes our everyday reality. As it does THE GROUND 267 </p>
<p class="calibre2">so, the more our habits dissolve, and the less of a difference there is between meditation and everyday life. Gradually you become like someone who can walk straight out into the garden through the glass door, unobstructed. And the sign that the ground of the ordinary mind is weakening is that we are able to rest more and more effortlessly in the nature of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Ground Luminosity dawns, the crucial issue will be how much we have been able to rest in the nature of mind, how much we have been able to unite our absolute nature and our everyday life, and how much we have been able to purify our ordinary condition into the state of primordial purity. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MEETING OF MOTHER AND CHILD </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a way in which we can prepare completely to recognize the dawning of the Ground Luminosity at the moment of death. This is through the very highest level of meditation (as I have explained in Chapter 10, "The Innermost Essence"), the final fruition of the practice of Dzogchen. It is called the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"union of two luminosities," which is also known as "the merging of Mother and Child Luminosities." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Mother Luminosity is the name we give to the Ground Luminosity. This is the fundamental, inherent nature of everything, which underlies our whole experience, and which manifests in its full glory at the moment of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Child Luminosity, also called the Path Luminosity, is the nature of our mind, which, if introduced by the master, and if recognized by us, we can then gradually stabilize through meditation, and more and more completely integrate into our action in life. When the integration is complete, recognition is complete and realization occurs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the Ground Luminosity is our inherent nature and the nature of everything, we do not recognize it, and it remains as if hidden. I like to think of the Child Luminosity as a key the master gives us to help us open the door to the recognition of the Ground Luminosity, whenever the opportunity arises. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine that you have to meet a woman arriving by plane. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you have no idea what she looks like, you might go to the airport and she could walk right past you and you would miss her. If you have a photo of her that is a good likeness, and you have a good picture of her in your mind, then you will recognize her as soon as she approaches you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Once the nature of mind has been introduced and you recognize it, you have the key to recognizing it again. But just as you have to keep the photograph with you and keep looking at it again and again, to be sure of recognizing the person you are going to meet at the airport, so you have to keep deepening and stabilizing your recognition of the nature of mind through regular practice. Then the recognition becomes so ingrained in you, so much a part of you, that you have no further need of the photograph; when you meet the person recognition is spontaneous and immediate. So, after sustained practice of the recognition of the nature of mind, when at the moment of death the Ground Luminosity dawns, you will be able then to recognize it and merge with it—as instinctively, say the masters of the past, as a little child running eagerly into its mother's lap, like old friends meeting, or a river flowing into the sea. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet this is extremely difficult. The only way to ensure this recognition is through stabilizing and perfecting the practice of merging the two luminosities now, while we are still alive. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is only possible through a lifetime of training and endeavor. As my master Dudjom Rinpoche said, if we don't practice the merging of the two luminosities now, and from now on, there is no saying that recognition will happen naturally at death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How exactly do we merge the luminosities? This is a very profound and advanced practice, and this is not the place to elaborate on it. But what we can say is this: When the master introduces us to the nature of mind, it is as if our sight has been restored, for we have been blind to the Ground Luminosity that is in everything. The master's introduction awakens in us a wisdom eye, with which we come to see clearly the true nature of whatever arises, the luminosity—Clear Light—nature of all our thoughts and emotions. Imagine that our recognition of the nature of mind comes, after stabilizing and perfecting the practice, to be like a steadily blazing sun. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thoughts and emotions go on arising; they are like waves of darkness. But each time the waves unfurl and meet the light, they dissolve immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As we develop this ability to recognize more and more, it becomes part of our daily vision. When we are able to bring the realization of our absolute nature into our everyday experience, the more chance there is that we will actually recognize the Ground Luminosity at the moment of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The proof of whether we have this key will be how we view our thoughts and emotions as they arise; whether we are able to penetrate them directly with the View and recognize their inherent luminosity nature, or whether we obscure it with our instinctive habitual reactions. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If the ground of our ordinary mind is completely purified, it is as if we have shattered the storehouse of our karma and so emptied the karmic supply for future rebirths. However, if we have not been able to completely purify our mind, there will still be remnants of past habits and karmic tendencies resting in this storehouse of karma. Whenever suitable conditions materialize, they will manifest, propelling us into new rebirths. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE DURATION OF THE GROUND LUMINOSITY<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Ground Luminosity dawns; for a practitioner, it lasts as long as he or she can rest, undistracted, in the state of the nature of mind. For most people, however, it lasts no longer than a snap of the fingers, and for some, the masters say, "as long as it takes to eat a meal." The vast majority of people do not recognize the Ground Luminosity at all, and instead they are plunged into a state of unconsciousness, which can last up to three and a half days. It is then that the consciousness finally leaves the body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This has led to a custom in Tibet of making sure that the body is not touched or disturbed for three days after death. It is especially important in the case of a practitioner, who may have merged with the Ground Luminosity and be resting in that state of the nature of mind. I remember in Tibet how everyone took great care to maintain a silent and peaceful atmosphere around the body, particularly in the case of a great master or practitioner, to avoid causing the slightest disturbance. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But even the body of an ordinary person is often not moved before three days have elapsed, since you never know if a person is realized or not, and it is uncertain when the consciousness has separated from the body. It is believed that if the body is touched in a certain place—if, for example, an injection is given—it may draw the consciousness to that spot. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then the consciousness of the dead person may leave through the nearest opening instead of through the fontanel, and take on an unfortunate rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some masters insist more than others on leaving the body for three days. Chadral Rinpoche, a Zen-like Tibetan master living in India and Nepal, told people who were complaining that a corpse might smell if it was kept in hot weather: "It's not as though you have to eat it, or try to sell it." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Strictly speaking, then, autopsies or cremations are best done after the three days' interval. However, these days, since it may not be at all practical or possible to keep a body this long without moving it, at least the phowa practice should be effected before the body is touched or moved in any way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE DEATH OF A MASTER </p>
<p class="calibre2">A realized practitioner continues to abide by the recognition of the nature of mind at the moment of death, and awakens into the Ground Luminosity when it manifests. He or she may even remain in that state for a number of days. Some practitioners and masters die sitting upright in meditation posture, and others in the "posture of the sleeping lion." Besides their perfect poise, there will be other signs that show they are resting in the state of the Ground Luminosity: There is still a certain color and glow in their face, the nose does not sink inward, the skin remains soft and flexible, the body does not become stiff, the eyes are said to keep a soft and compassionate glow, and there is still a warmth at the heart. Great care is taken that the master's body is not touched, and silence is maintained until he or she has arisen from this state of meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gyalwang Karmapa, a great master and head of one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, died in hospital in the United States in 1981. He was an extraordinary inspiration to all those around him because of his constant cheerfulness and compassion. Dr. Ranulfo Sanchez, chief of surgery, said: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3"> I personally felt that His Holiness was not just an ordinary man. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">When he looked at you, it was like he was searching inside you,</i> <i class="calibre3">as if he could see through you. I was very struck by the way he</i> <i class="calibre3">looked at me and seemed to understand what was going on. His</i> <i class="calibre3">Holiness affected practically everyone in the hospital who came in</i> <i class="calibre3">contact with him. Many times when we felt he was near death, he</i> <i class="calibre3">would smile at us and tell us we were wrong, and then he'd</i> <i class="calibre3">improve. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">His Holiness never took any pain medication. We doctors would</i> <i class="calibre3">see him and realize he must be in a lot of pain, so we'd ask him, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">"Are you having a lot of pain today?" He'd say, "No." Towards</i> <i class="calibre3">the end we knew he could sense our anxiety and it became a running joke. We'd ask him, "Are you having any fain?" He'd smile</i> <i class="calibre3">this extremely kind smile and say, "No." </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">All his vital signs were very low. I give him a shot</i>...  <i class="calibre3"> so that</i> <i class="calibre3">he could communicate in his last minutes. I left the room for a few</i> <i class="calibre3">minutes while he conversed with the tulkus, whom he assured he</i> <i class="calibre3">was not intending to die that day. When I returned five minutes</i> <i class="calibre3">later, he was sitting straight up, with his eyes wide open, and said</i> <i class="calibre3">clearly, "Hello, how are you?" All his vital signs had reversed and</i> <i class="calibre3">within half an hour he was sitting up in bed, talking and laughing. Medically this is unheard of the nurses were all white. One</i> <i class="calibre3">of them lifted her sleeve to show me her arm, covered with goose-bumps. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The nursing staff noticed that Karmapa's body did not follow the usual progression of rigor mortis and decay, but seemed to remain just as it had been when he died. After a while they became aware that the area around his heart was still warm. Dr. Sanchez said: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">They brought me into the room about thirty-six hours after he died. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I felt the area right over his heart, and it was warmer than the</i> <i class="calibre3">surrounding area. Its something for which there is no medical</i> <i class="calibre3">explanation</i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Some masters pass away sitting in meditation, with the body supporting itself. Kalu Rinpoche died in 1989 in his monastery in the Himalayas, with a number of masters and a doctor and nurse present. His closest disciple wrote: <i class="calibre3">Rinpoche himself tried to sit up, and had difficulty to do so. Lama</i> <i class="calibre3">Gyaltsen, feeling that this was perhaps the time, and that not to</i> <i class="calibre3">sit up could create an obstacle for Rinpoche, supported Rinpoche's</i> <i class="calibre3">back as he sat up. Rinpoche extended his hand to me, and I also</i> <i class="calibre3">helped him to sit up. Rinpoche wanted to sit absolutely straight,</i> <i class="calibre3">both saying this and indicating with a gesture of his hand. The</i> <i class="calibre3">doctor and nurse were upset by this, and so Rinpoche relaxed his</i> <i class="calibre3">posture slightly. He, nevertheless, assumed meditation posture.... </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Rinpoche placed his hands in meditation posture, his open eyes</i> <i class="calibre3">gazed outwards in meditation gaze, and his lips moved softly. A</i> <i class="calibre3">profound feeling of peace and happiness settled on us all and</i> <i class="calibre3">spread through our minds. All of us present felt that the indescribable happiness that was filing us was the faintest reflection of</i> <i class="calibre3">what was pervading Rinpoche's mind... Slowly Rinpoche's gaze</i> <i class="calibre3">and his eyelids lowered and the breath stopped.2 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I shall always remember the death of my own beloved master, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro, in the summer of 1959. During the last part of his life, he would try and leave his monastery as little as possible. Masters of all traditions would flock to him for teachings, and holders of all lineages would look to him for instructions, as he was the source of their transmission. The monastery where he lived, Dzongsar, became one of the most vibrant centers of spiritual activity in Tibet as all the great Lamas came and went. His word in the region was law; he was such a great master that almost everybody was his disciple, so much so that he had the power to stop civil wars by threatening to withdraw his spiritual protection from the fighters of both sides. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, as the grip of the Chinese invaders tight-ened, conditions in Kham deteriorated rapidly, and even as a young boy I could sense the impending menace of what was to come. In 1955 my master had certain signs that showed he should leave Tibet. First he went on a pilgrimage to the sacred sites of central and southern Tibet; and then, to fulfill a deep wish of his master, he made a pilgrimage to the holy places of India, and I went with him. We all hoped that the situation in the east might improve while we were away. It turned out, I was to realize later, that my master's decision to leave had been taken as a sign by many other Lamas and ordinary people that Tibet was doomed, and it allowed them to escape in good time. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My master had a longstanding invitation to visit Sikkim, a small country in the Himalayas and one of the sacred lands of Padmasambhava. Jamyang Khyentse was the incarnation of Sikkim's holiest saint, and the King of Sikkim had requested him to teach there and bless the land with his presence. Once they heard he had gone there, many masters came from Tibet to receive his teachings, and brought with them rare texts and scriptures that might not otherwise have survived. Jamyang Khyentse was a master of masters, and the Palace Temple where he lived became once again a great spiritual center. As the conditions in Tibet became more and more disastrous, more and more Lamas gathered around him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes great masters who teach a lot, it is said, do not live very long; it is almost as if they attract toward them any obstacles there are to the spiritual teachings. There were prophecies that if my master had put aside teaching and traveled as an unknown hermit to remote corners of the country, he would have lived for many more years. In fact, he tried to do this: When we started on our last journey from Kham, he left all his possessions behind him and went in complete secrecy, not intending to teach but to travel on pilgrimage. Yet once they found out who he was, people everywhere requested him to give teachings and initiations. So vast was his compassion that, knowing what he was risking, he sacrificed his own life to keep on teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was in Sikkim, then, that Jamyang Khyentse fell ill; at that very same time, the terrible news came that Tibet had finally fallen. All the seniormost Lamas, the heads of the lineages, arrived one after another to visit him, and prayers and rituals for his long life went on day and night. Everybody took part. We all pleaded with him to continue living, for a master of his greatness has the power to decide when it is time to leave his body. He just lay there in bed, accepted all our offerings and laughed, and said with a knowing smile: "All right, just to be auspicious, I'll say I will live." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The first indication we had that my master was going to die was through Gyalwang Karmapa. He told Karmapa that he had completed the work he had come to do in this life, and he had decided to leave this world. One of Khyentse's close attendants burst into tears as soon as Karmapa revealed this to him, and then we knew. His death was eventually to occur just after we had heard that the three great monasteries of Tibet, Sera, Drepung, and Ganden, had been occupied by the Chinese. It seemed tragically symbolic that as Tibet collapsed, so this great being, the embodiment of Tibetan Buddhism, was passing away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro died at three o'clock in the morning, on the sixth day of the fifth Tibetan month. Ten days before, while we were doing a whole night's practice for his long life, suddenly the ground was shaken by an enormous earthquake. According to the Buddhist Sutras, this is a sign that marks the imminent passing of an enlightened being.3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">For three days after he had passed away, complete secrecy was kept, and no one was allowed to know that Khyentse had died. I was told simply that his health had taken a turn for the worse, and instead of sleeping in his room as I usually did, I was asked to sleep in another room. My master's closest assistant and master of ceremonies, Lama Chokden, had been with my master longer than anyone. He was a silent, serious, ascetic man with piercing eyes and sunken cheeks, and a dignified and elegant but humble manner. Chokden was known for his fundamental integrity, his deep, human decency, his courtesy of heart, and his extraordinary memory: He seemed to remember every word my master said, and every story, and he knew the smallest details of all the most intricate rituals and their significance. He was also an exemplary practitioner and a teacher in his own right. We watched, then, as Lama Chokden continued to carry my master's meals into his room, but the expression on his face was somber. We kept asking how Khyentse was, and Chokden would only say: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"He is just the same." In certain traditions, after a master has died and during the time he remains in meditation after death, it is important to maintain secrecy. It was only three days later, as I have said, that we finally heard that he had died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Government of India then sent a telegram to Peking. </p>
<p class="calibre2">From there the message went out to my master's own monastery, Dzongsar, in Tibet, where many of the monks were already in tears, because somehow they knew he was dying. Just before we had left, Khyentse had made a mysterious pledge that he would return once before he died. And he did. On New Year's Day that year, about six months before he actually passed away, when a ritual dance was being performed, many of the older monks had a vision of him, just as he used to be, appearing in the sky. At the monastery my master had founded a study college, famous for producing some of the most excellent scholars of recent times. In the main temple stood a huge statue of the future Buddha, Maitreya. Early one morning, soon after the New Year's Day when the vision had appeared in the sky, the caretaker of the temple opened the door: Khyentse was sitting in the Buddha Maitreya's lap. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My master passed away in "the sleeping lion's posture." All the signs were there to show that he was still in a state of meditation, and no one touched the body for three whole days. The moment when he then came out of his meditation will stay with me all my life: His nose suddenly deflated, the color in his face drained away, and then his head fell slightly to one side. Until that moment there had been a certain poise and strength and life about his body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was evening when we washed the body, dressed it, and took it from his bedroom up into the main temple of the palace. Crowds of people were there, filing around the temple to show their respect. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then something extraordinary happened. An incandescent, milky light, looking like a thin and luminous fog, began to appear and gradually spread everywhere. The palace temple had four large electric lamps outside; normally at that time of the evening they shone brightly, as it was already dark by seven o'clock. Yet they were dimmed by this mysterious light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Apa Pant, who was then Political Officer to Sikkim, was the first to ring and inquire what on earth it could be. Then many others started to call; this strange, unearthly light was seen by hundreds of people. One of the other masters then told us that such manifestations of light are said in the Tantras to be a sign of someone attaining Buddhahood. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was originally planned that Jamyang Khyentse's body was to be kept in the palace temple for one week, but very soon we started receiving telegrams from his disciples. It was 1959; many of them, including Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, had just arrived in exile, having made the long and dangerous escape from Tibet. They all begged that the body be kept so that they could have a chance to see it. So we kept it for two more weeks. Each day there were four different prayer sessions with hundreds of monks, headed by Lamas of all the different schools, and often with the lineage holders presiding, and thousands upon thousands of butter-lamps were offered. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The body did not smell or start to decay, so we kept it for another week. India is fiercely hot in the summer, but even though week after week went by, the body showed no signs of decay. We ended up keeping Jamyang Khyentse's body for six months; a whole environment of teaching and practice evolved in its holy presence: teachings that Jamyang Khyentse had been giving, which were incomplete when he died, were finished by his oldest disciples, and many, many monks were ordained. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally we took the body to the place he had chosen for the cremation. Tashiding is one of the most sacred sites in Sikkim, and stands on top of a hill. All the disciples went there, and we constructed the <i class="calibre3"> stupa</i> for his relics by ourselves, although in India all grueling manual work is usually done by hired laborers. Everybody, young and old, from even a master like Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche to the most ordinary person, carried stones up the hill and built the whole thing with their own bare hands. It was the greatest possible testimony to the devotion he inspired. </p>
<p class="calibre2">No words would ever be able to convey the loss of Jamyang Khyentse's death. In leaving Tibet I and my family lost all our lands and possessions, but I was too young to have formed any attachment to them. But losing Jamyang Khyentse was a loss so enormous that I still mourn it, so many years later. My entire childhood had been lived in the sunlight of his presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I had slept in a small bed at the foot of his bed, and woke for many years to the sound of him whispering his morning prayers and clicking his mala, his Buddhist rosary. His words, his teachings, the great peaceful radiance of his presence, his smile, all of these are indelible memories for me. He is the inspiration of my life, and it is his presence as well as Padmasambhava's that I always invoke when I am in difficulties or when I teach. His death was an incalculable loss for the world and an incalculable loss for Tibet. I used to think of him, as I thought also of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, that if Buddhism was destroyed and only he remained, nevertheless Buddhism would still be alive, for he was the complete embodiment of what Buddhism means. With Jamyang Khyentse's passing, a whole epoch, sometimes it seems a whole dimension of spiritual power and knowledge, passed with him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He died when he was only sixty-seven, and I often wonder how the entire future of Tibetan Buddhism would have been different if Jamyang Khyentse had lived to inspire its growth in exile and in the West with the same authority and infinite respect for all traditions and lineages that had made him so beloved in Tibet. Because he was the master of masters, and since the lineage-holders of all the traditions had received initiations and teachings from him and so revered him as their root-teacher, he was able naturally to draw them together, in a spirit of devoted harmony and cooperation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And yet, a great master never dies. Jamyang Khyentse is here inspiring me as I write this; he is the force behind this book and whatever I teach; he is the foundation and basis of the spirit behind everything I do; it is he who goes on giving me my inner direction. His blessing and the confidence it gives me have been with me, guiding me through all the difficulties of trying to represent, in whatever way I can, the tradition of which he was so sublime a representative. His noble face is more alive to me now than any of the faces of the living, and in his eyes I always see that light of transcendent wisdom and transcendent compassion that no power in heaven or earth can put out. </p>
<p class="calibre2">May all of you who read this book come to know him a little as I know him, may all of you be as inspired as I have been by the dedication of his life and the splendor of his dying, may all of you draw from his example of total dedication to the welfare of all sentient beings the courage and wisdom you will need to work for the truth in this time! </p>

<p class="calibre2">SEVENTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Intrinsic Radiance </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">AS THE GROUND LUMINOSITY DAWNS AT DEATH, </p>
<p class="calibre2">an experienced practitioner will maintain full awareness and merge with it, thereby attaining liberation. But if we fail to recognize the Ground Luminosity, then we encounter the next bardo, the luminous bardo of dharmata. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The teaching on the bardo of dharmata is a very special instruction, one specific to Dzogchen practice and treasured at the heart of the Dzogchen teachings over the centuries. Initially I felt some hesitation about publicly presenting this most sacred of teachings, and in fact if there had not been any precedent I might not have done so at all. However, the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Dead</i> and a number of other books that refer to the bardo of dharmata have already been published, and have led to some naive conclusions. I feel it is extremely important, and timely, to make available a straightforward clarification of this bardo, putting it into its authentic context. I should stress that I have not gone into any detail about the advanced practices involved; none of these practices could, under any circumstances, ever be done effectively except with the instructions and guidance of a qualified master, and when the commitment and connection with that master is kept completely pure. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have gathered insights from many different sources in order to make this chapter, which I feel is one of the most important in this book, as lucid as possible. I hope that through it some of you will make a connection with this extraordinary teaching, and be inspired to investigate further and to begin to practice yourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE<b class="calibre4"> </b>FOUR PHASES OF DHARMATA<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Sanskrit word <i class="calibre3"> dharmata, did nyi</i> in Tibetan, means the intrinsic nature of everything, the essence of things as they  are. Dharmata is the naked, unconditioned truth, the nature of reality, or the true nature of phenomenal existence. What we are discussing here is something fundamental to the whole understanding of the nature of mind and the nature of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The end of the dissolution process and dawning of the Ground Luminosity has opened up an entirely new dimension, which now begins to unfold. One helpful way I have found to explain it is to compare it with the way night turns into day. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The final phase of the dissolution process of dying is the black experience of the stage of "full attainment." It is described as </p>
<p class="calibre2">"like a sky shrouded in darkness." The arising of the Ground Luminosity is like the clarity in the empty sky just before dawn. Now gradually the sun of dharmata begins to rise in all its splendor, illuminating the contours of the land in all directions. The natural radiance of Rigpa manifests spontaneously and blazes out as energy and light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as the sun rises in that clear and empty sky, the luminous appearances of the bardo of dharmata will all arise from the all-pervading space of the Ground Luminosity. The name we give to this display of sound, light, and color is "spontaneous presence," for it is always and inherently present within the expanse of "primordial purity," which is its ground. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What is actually taking place here is a process of unfoldment, in which mind and its fundamental nature are gradually becoming more and more manifest. The bardo of dharmata is one stage in that process. For it is through this dimension of light and energy that mind unfolds from its purest state, the Ground Luminosity, toward its manifestation as form in the next bardo, the bardo of becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I find it extremely suggestive that modern physics has shown that when matter is investigated, it is revealed as an ocean of energy and light. "Matter, as it were, is condensed or frozen light... all matter is a condensation of light into patterns moving back and forth at average speeds which are less than the speed of light," remarks David Bohm. Modern physics also understands light in a many-sided way: "It's energy and it's also information—content, form and structure. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It's the potential for everything."1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The bardo of dharmata has four phases, each one of which presents another opportunity for liberation. If the opportunity is not taken, then the next phase will unfold. The explanation I am giving here of this bardo originates in the Dzogchen Tantras, where it is taught that only through the special advanced practice of luminosity, Togal, can the true significance of the bardo of dharmata be in any real sense understood. The bardo of dharmata, then, figures with far less prominence in other cycles of teachings on death in the Tibetan tradition. Even in the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> which also belongs to the Dzogchen teachings, the sequence of these four phases is only implicit, as if slightly hidden, and does not appear there in such a clear and ordered structure. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I must stress, however, that all words could possibly do is give some conceptual picture of what might happen in the bardo of dharmata. The appearances of this bardo will remain just conceptual images until the practitioner has perfected the Togal practice, when each detail of the description I am about to give becomes an undeniable personal experience. What I am trying to give you here is some sense that such a marvelous and amazing dimension could exist, and to complete my description of the whole of the bardos. I also profoundly hope that this complete description could act perhaps as some kind of reminder when you go through the process of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1.  <i class="calibre3"> Luminosity</i>— <i class="calibre3">The Landscape of Light</i> In the bardo of dharmata, you take on a body of light. The first phase of this bardo is when "space dissolves into luminosity": </p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly you become aware of a flowing vibrant world of sound, light, and color. All the ordinary features of our familiar environment have melted into an all-pervasive landscape of light. This is brilliantly clear and radiant, transparent and mul-ticolored, unlimited by any kind of dimension or direction, shimmering and constantly in motion. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Dead</i> calls it "like a mirage on a plain in the heat of summer." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Its colors are the natural expression of the intrinsic elemental qualities of the mind: space is perceived as blue light, water as white, earth as yellow, fire as red, and wind as green. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How stable these dazzling appearances of light are in the bardo of dharmata depends entirely upon what stability you have managed to attain in Togal practice. Only a real mastery of this practice will enable you to stabilize the experience and so use it to gain liberation. Otherwise the bardo of dharmata will simply flash by like a bolt of lightning; you will not even know that it has occurred. Let me stress again that only a practitioner of Togal will be able to make the all-important recognition: that these radiant manifestations of light have no existence separate from the nature of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Union</i>— <i class="calibre3">The Deities </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">If you are unable to recognize this as the spontaneous display of Rigpa, the simple rays and colors then begin to integrate and coalesce into points or balls of light of different sizes, called tikle. Within them the "mandalas of the peaceful and wrathful deities" appear, as enormous spherical concentra-tions of light seeming to occupy the whole of space. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the second phase, known as "luminosity dissolving into union," where the luminosity manifests in the form of buddhas or deities of various size, color, and form, holding different attributes. The brilliant light they emanate is blinding and dazzling, the sound is tremendous, like the roaring of a thousand thunderclaps, and the rays and beams of light are like lasers, piercing everything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">These are the "forty-two peaceful and fifty-eight wrathful deities" depicted in the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead. </i> They unfold over a certain period of "days," taking on their own characteristic mandala pattern of five-fold clusters. This is a vision that fills the whole of your perception with such intensity that if you are unable to recognize it for what it is, it appears terrifying and threatening. Sheer fear and blind panic can consume you, and you faint. </p>
<p class="calibre2">From yourself and from the deities, very fine shafts of light stream out, joining your heart with theirs. Countless luminous spheres appear in their rays, which increase and then "roll up," </p>
<p class="calibre2">as the deities all dissolve into you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3.  <i class="calibre3"> Wisdom </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">If again you fail to recognize and gain stability, the next phase unfolds, called "union dissolving into wisdom." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another fine shaft of light springs out from your heart and an enormous vision unfolds from it; however, every detail remains distinct and precise. This is the display of the various aspects of wisdom, which appear together in a show of unfurled carpets of light and resplendent spherical luminous tikles: First, on a carpet of deep blue light appear shimmering tikles of sapphire blue, in patterns of five. Above that, on a carpet of white light, appear radiant tikles, white like crystal. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Above, on a carpet of yellow light, appear golden tikles, and upon that a carpet of red light supports ruby red tikles. They are crowned by a radiant sphere like an outspread canopy made of peacock feathers. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This brilliant display of light is the manifestation of the five wisdoms: wisdom of all-encompassing space, mirror-like wisdom, equalizing wisdom, wisdom of discernment, and all-accomplishing wisdom. But since the all-accomplishing wisdom is <i class="calibre3"> only</i> perfected at the time of enlightenment, it does not appear yet. Therefore there is no green carpet of light and tikles, yet it is inherent within all the other colors. What is being manifested here is our potential of enlightenment, and the all-accomplishing wisdom will only appear when we become a buddha. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you do not attain liberation here through resting undistracted in the nature of mind, the carpets of light and their tikles, along with your Rigpa, all dissolve into the radiant sphere of light, which is like the canopy of peacock feathers. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4.  <i class="calibre3"> Spontaneous Presence </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">This heralds the final phase of the bardo of dharmata, "wisdom dissolving into spontaneous presence." Now the whole of reality presents itself in one tremendous display. First the state of primordial purity dawns like an open, cloudless sky. Then the peaceful and wrathful deities appear, followed by the pure realms of the buddhas, and below them the six realms of samsaric existence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The limitlessness of this vision is utterly beyond our ordinary imagination. Every possibility is presented: from wisdom and liberation to confusion and rebirth. At this point you will find yourself endowed with powers of clairvoyant perception and recollection. For example, with total clairvoyance and your senses unobstructed, you will know your past and future lives, see into others' minds, and have knowledge of all six realms of existence. In an instant you will vividly recall whatever teachings you have heard, and even teachings you have never heard will awaken in your mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The entire vision then dissolves back into its original essence, like a tent collapsing once its ropes are cut. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you have the stability to recognize these manifestations as the "self-radiance" of your own Rigpa, you will be liberated. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But without the experience of Togal practice, you will be unable to look at the visions of the deities, which are "as bright as the sun." Instead, as a result of the habitual tendencies of your previous lives, your gaze will be drawn downward to the six realms. It is <i class="calibre3"> those</i> that you will recognize and which will lure you again into delusion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> periods of days are allotted to the experiences of the bardo of dharmata. These are not solar days of twenty-four hours, because in the sphere of dharmata we have gone completely beyond all limits such as time and space. These days are "meditation days," and refer to the length of time we have been able to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, or in one single state of mind. With no stability in meditation practice, these days could be minutely short, and the appearance of the peaceful and wrathful deities so fleeting that we cannot even register they have arisen. </p>
<p class="calibre2">UNDERSTANDING DHARMATA </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now when the bardo of dharmata dawns upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will abandon all fear and terror, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I will recognize whatever appears as the display of my own Rigpa,</i> <i class="calibre3">And know it to be the natural appearance of this bardo;</i> <i class="calibre3">Now that I have reached this crucial point,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will not fear the peaceful and wrathful deities, that arise from the</i> <i class="calibre3">nature of my very own mind. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The key to understanding this bardo is that all the experiences that take place in it are the natural radiance of the nature of our mind. What is happening is that different aspects of its enlightened energy are being released. Just as the dancing rainbows of light scattered by a crystal are its natural display, so too the dazzling appearances of dharmata cannot be separated from the nature of mind.  <i class="calibre3"> They are its spontaneous</i> <i class="calibre3">expression. </i> So however terrifying the appearances may be, says the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> they have no more claim on your fear than a stuffed lion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Strictly speaking, however, it would be wrong to call these appearances "visions" or even "experiences," because vision and experience depend upon a dualistic relationship between a perceiver and something perceived. If we can recognize the appearances of the bardo of dharmata as the wisdom energy of our very own mind, there is no difference between perceiver and perceived, and this is an experience of non-duality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To enter into that experience completely is to attain liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For, as Kalu Rinpoche says, "Liberation arises at that moment in the after-death state when consciousness can realize its experiences to be nothing other than mind itself."2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">However, now that we are no longer grounded or shielded by a physical body or world, the energies of the nature of mind released in the bardo state can look overwhelmingly real, and appear to take on an objective existence. They seem to inhabit the world outside of us. And without the stability of practice, we have no knowledge of anything that is non-dual, that is not dependent on our own perception. Once we mistake the appearances as separate from us, as "external visions," </p>
<p class="calibre2">we respond with fear or hope, which leads us into delusion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as in the dawning of the Ground Luminosity recognition was the key to liberation, so here in the bardo of dharmata it is also. Only here it is the recognition of <i class="calibre3"> the</i> <i class="calibre3">self-radiance of Rigpa, </i> the manifesting energy of the nature of mind, that makes the difference between liberation or continuing in an uncontrolled cycle of rebirth. Take, for example, the appearances of the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities, which occur in the second phase of this bardo. These consist of the buddhas of the five buddha families, their female counterparts, male and female bodhisattvas, the buddhas of the six realms, and a number of wrathful and protective deities. All emerge amidst the brilliant light of the five wisdoms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How are we to understand these buddhas or deities? "Each one of these pure forms expresses an enlightened perspective of a part of our impure experience."3 The five masculine buddhas are the pure aspect of the five aggregates of ego. Their five wisdoms are the pure aspect of the five negative emotions. The five female buddhas are the pure elemental qualities of mind, which we experience as the impure elements of our physical body and environment. The eight bodhisattvas are the pure aspect of the different types of consciousness, and their female counterparts are the objects of these consciousnesses. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whether the pure vision of the buddha families and their wisdoms manifests, or the impure vision of the aggregates and negative emotions arises, they are intrinsically the same in their fundamental nature. The difference lies in <i class="calibre3"> how we recognize them, </i> and whether we recognize that they emerge from the ground of the nature of mind as its enlightened energy. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Take, for example, what manifests in our ordinary mind as a thought of <i class="calibre3"> desire; </i> if its true nature is recognized, it arises, free of grasping, as the "wisdom of discernment." Hatred and <i class="calibre3">anger, </i> when truly recognized, arise as diamond-like clarity, free of grasping; this is the "mirror-like wisdom." When <i class="calibre3"> ignorance</i> is recognized, it arises as vast and natural clarity without concepts: the "wisdom of all-encompassing space."  <i class="calibre3"> Pride, </i> when recognized, is realized as non-duality and equality: the "equalizing wisdom."  <i class="calibre3"> jealousy, </i> when recognized, is freed from partial-ity and grasping, and arises as the "all-accomplishing wisdom." </p>
<p class="calibre2">So the five negative emotions arise as the direct result of our not recognizing their true nature. When truly recognized, they are purified and liberated, and arise themselves as none other than the display of the five wisdoms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of dharmata, when you fail to recognize the brilliant lights of these wisdoms, then self-grasping enters your </p>
<p class="calibre2">"perception," just as, one master says, a person who is seriously ill with a high fever will begin to hallucinate and see all kinds of delusions. So, for example, if you fail to recognize the red, ruby light of the wisdom of discernment, it arises as fire, for it is the pure essence of the fire element; if you fail to recognize the true nature of the golden radiance of the equalizing wisdom, then it arises as the element earth, because it is the pure essence of the earthelement; and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is how, when self-grasping enters into the "perception" </p>
<p class="calibre2">of the appearances of the bardo of dharmata, they are transformed, you could almost say solidified, through that into the various bases of delusion of samsara. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One Dzogchen master uses the example of ice and water to show how this lack of recognition and self-grasping unfold: Water is usually liquid, an element with wonderful qualities, that purifies and quenches thirst. But when it freezes, it solidifies into ice. In a similar way, whenever self-grasping arises it solidifies both our inner experience and the way we perceive the world around us. Yet just as in the heat of the sun ice will melt into water, so in the light of recognition, our unbound wisdom nature is revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now we can see exactly how, after the dawning of the Ground Luminosity and the bardo of dharmata, samsara actually arises as a result of two successive failures to recognize the essential nature of mind. In the first the Ground Luminosity, the ground of the nature of mind, is not recognized; if it had been, liberation would have been attained. In the second the energy nature of the nature of mind manifests, and a second chance for liberation presents itself; if that is not recognized, arising negative emotions start to solidify into different false perceptions, which together go on to create the illusory realms we call samsara, and which imprison us in the cycle of birth and death. The whole of spiritual practice, then, is dedicated to directly reversing what I would call this progress of ignorance, and so of de-creating, de-solidifying those interlinked and interdependent false perceptions that have led to our entrapment in the illusory reality of our own invention. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as when the Ground Luminosity dawned at the moment of death, here too in the bardo of dharmata, liberation cannot be taken for granted. When the brilliant light of wisdom shines out, it is accompanied by a display of simple, comforting, cozy sounds and lights, less challenging and overwhelming than the light of wisdom. These dim lights—smoky, yellow, green, blue, red, and white—are our habitual, unconscious tendencies accumulated by anger, greed, ignorance, desire, jealousy, and pride. These are the emotions that create the six realms of samsara: hell, hungry ghost, animal, human, demigod, and god realms, respectively. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If we have not recognized and stabilized the dharmata nature of mind in life, we are instinctively drawn toward the dim lights of the six realms, as the basic tendency toward grasping, which we have built up during life, begins to stir and awaken. Threatened by the dynamic brilliance of wisdom, the mind retreats. The cozy lights, the invitation of our habitual tendencies, lure us toward a rebirth, determined by the particular negative emotion that dominates our karma and our minds tream. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us take an example of the appearance of one of the peaceful buddhas from the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> which will illustrate this whole process. The master or spiritual friend addresses the consciousness of the dead person: <i class="calibre3">O son/daughter of an enlightened family, listen without distraction! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">On the third day, a yellow light will arise which is the pure</i> <i class="calibre3">essence of the element earth. Simultaneously, from the yellow</i> <i class="calibre3">southern buddha-field known as "The Glorious," the Buddha</i> <i class="calibre3">Ratnasambhava will appear before you, his body yellow in color,</i> <i class="calibre3">and holding a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hand. He presides upon</i> <i class="calibre3">a throne borne up by horses and is embraced by the supreme</i> <i class="calibre3">female consort, Mamaki. Around him are the two male bodhisattvas, Akashagarbha and Samantabhadra and the two</i> <i class="calibre3">female bodhisattvas, Mala and Dhupa, so that six buddha bodies</i> <i class="calibre3">appear from within the expanse of rainbow light. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The inherent purity of the skandha of feeling</i>— <i class="calibre3">which is the. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">"equalizing wisdom" </i>— <i class="calibre3">a yellow light, dazzling and adorned with</i> <i class="calibre3">ikies of light, large and small, radiant and clear, and unbearable to</i> <i class="calibre3">the eyes, will stream toward you from the heart of Ratnasambhava</i> <i class="calibre3">and his consort, and pierce your heart so that your eyes cannot</i> <i class="calibre3">stand to gaze at it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">At exactly the same time, together with the light of wisdom, a</i> <i class="calibre3">dull blue light representing the human realm will come toward you</i> <i class="calibre3">and fierce your heart. Then, driven by pride, you will flee in terror</i> <i class="calibre3">from the intensity of the yellow light, but delight in the dim blue</i> <i class="calibre3">light of the human realm, and so become attached to it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">At this moment do not be afraid of the piercing yellow light, in</i> <i class="calibre3">all its dazzling radiance, but recognize it as wisdom. Let your</i> <i class="calibre3">Rigpa rest in it, relaxed, at ease, in a state free of any activity. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And have confidence in it; have devotion and longing towards it. If</i> <i class="calibre3">you recognize it as the natural radiance of your own Rigpa, even</i> <i class="calibre3">though you do not have devotion and have not said the necessary</i> <i class="calibre3">prayer of inspiration, all the buddha bodies and rays of light will</i> <i class="calibre3">merge inseparably with you, and you will attain buddhahood. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">If you do not recognize it as the natural radiance of your own</i> <i class="calibre3">Rigpa, then pray to it with devotion, thinking, "This is the light of</i> <i class="calibre3">the compassionate energy of Buddha Ratnasambhava. I take</i> <i class="calibre3">refuge in it." Since it</i> is <i class="calibre3"> in fact the Buddha Ratnasambhava coming</i> <i class="calibre3">to guide you amid the terrors of the bardo, and it</i> is <i class="calibre3"> the light-ray</i> <i class="calibre3">hook of his compassionate energy, so fill your heart with devotion</i> <i class="calibre3">to it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Do not delight in the dim blue light of the human realm. This</i> <i class="calibre3">is the seductive path of habitual tendencies which you have accumulated through intense pride. If you are attached to it you will</i> <i class="calibre3">fall into the human realm, where you will experience the suffering</i> <i class="calibre3">of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and you will miss the chance</i> <i class="calibre3">to emerge from the swamp of samsara. This (dull blue light) is an</i> <i class="calibre3">obstacle blocking the path to liberation, so do not look at it, but</i> <i class="calibre3">abandon pride! Abandon its habitual tendencies! Do not be</i> <i class="calibre3">attached (to the dull blue light)! Do not yearn for it! Feel devotion</i> <i class="calibre3">and longing for the dazzling, radiant yellow light, focus with total</i> <i class="calibre3">attention on the Buddha Ratnasmabhava, and say this prayer:</i> <i class="calibre3">Alas! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">When through intense pride I wander in samsara,</i> <i class="calibre3">May the Buddha Ratnasambhava lead the way</i> <i class="calibre3">On the radiant path of light which is the "equalizing wisdom," </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May the supreme female consort Mamaki walk behind me-,</i> <i class="calibre3">May they help me through the dangerous pathway of the bardo,</i> <i class="calibre3">And bring me to the perfect buddha state. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">By saying this prayer of inspiration with deep devotion, you</i> <i class="calibre3">will dissolve into rainbow light in the heart of the Buddha</i> <i class="calibre3">Ratnasambhava and his consort and become a Sambhogakaya</i> <i class="calibre3">Buddha5 in the southern buddha-field known as "The Glorious." </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">This description of the appearance of the Buddha Ratnasambhava concludes by explaining that through this </p>
<p class="calibre2">"showing "  by the master or spiritual friend, liberation is certain , however weak the dead person's capacities may be. Yet, even after  bein g "shown"  many times , the  <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book  of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Dead</i> says, ther e ar e thos e who , becaus e of negative karma , will not recognize an d gain liberation. Disturbed by desire an d obscurations and terrified by the different sounds and lights , the y will flee. So, on the following "day,"  the next buddha, Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless Light, with his mandala of deities , will appear in all the splendor of his dazzling red light, manifesting together  with the dim, seductive, yellow light-path of the hungry ghosts, which is created out of desire an d meanness. And so the  <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book  of the Dead </i> introduces the appearance of each of the peaceful an d wrathful deities in turn in a similar  way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am often asked: "Will the deities appear to a Western person? And if so, will it be in familiar, Western forms?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">The manifestations of the bardo of dharmata are called </p>
<p class="calibre2">"spontaneously present." This means that they are inherent and unconditioned, and exist in us all. Their arising is not dependent on any spiritual realization we may have; only the recognition of them is. They are not unique to Tibetans; they are a universal and fundamental experience, but the way they are perceived depends on our conditioning. Since they are by nature limitless, they have the freedom then to manifest in any form. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore the deities can take on forms we are most familiar with in our lives. For example, for Christian practitioners, the deities might take the form of Christ or the Virgin Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Generally, the whole purpose of the enlightened manifestation of the buddhas is to help us, so they may take on whatever form is most appropriate and beneficial for us. But in whatever form the deities appear, it is important to recognize that there is definitely no difference whatsoever in their fundamental nature. <b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">RECOGNITION<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">In Dzogchen it is explained that just as a person will not recognize the Ground Luminosity without a true realization of the nature of mind and a stable experience of Trekcho practice, so without the stability of Togal hardly anyone can recognize the bardo of dharmata. An accomplished Toga l practitione r  wh o ha s perfected and stabilized the luminosity of the nature of min d has already come to a direct knowledge in his or  her  life of the ver y sam e manifestations tha t will emerg e in the bardo of dharmata. Thi s energy an d light, then, lie within us, although at the momen t the y ar e hidden. Yet whe n the bod y an d grosse r  levels of mind die, the y ar e naturally freed , an d the sound, color, an d light of our  true nature blaze out . </p>
<p class="calibre2">However , it is not only through Togal tha t thi s bardo can be used as an opportunity for  liberation .Practitioners of Tantra in Buddhism will relate the appearances of the bardo of dharmata to thei r  own practice In Tantra the principle of deities is a way of communicating. It is difficult to relate to the presence of enlightened energies if they hav e no form or  ground for  personal communication. the deities ar e understood as metaphors, which personalize an d capture the infinite energies an d qualities of the wisdom min d of the buddhas. Personify-ing them in the form of deities enables the practitioner  to recognize the m an d relate to them. Through training in creating an d reabsorbing the deitie s in the practice of visualization, he or  she realizes tha t the mind tha t perceives the deity and the deity itself ar e not separate . </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibetaa Buddhism practitioners will have a yidam, tha t is, a practice of a particular  buddha or  deit y with which the y hav e a strong karmic connection, which for  the m is an embodiment of the truth, and which the y invok e as the heart of thei r  practice. Instead of perceiving the appearances of the dharmata as external phenomena, the Tantric practitioners will relate the m to thei r  yida m practice, an d unite and merge with the appearances. Since in their practice they have recognized the yidam as the natural radiance of the enlightened mind , they ar e abl e to view the appearances with thi s recognition, an d let the m arise as the deity. Wit h thi s pure perception, a practitioner recognizes whatever appears in the bardo as none other tha n the displa y of the yidam. Then, through the power of his practice an d the blessin g of the deity, he or  she will gain liberation in the bardo of dharmata. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thi s is wh y in the Tibetan tradition the advic e given to lay people and ordinary practitioners unfamiliar with the yidam practice is tha t whatever  appearances arise , the y shoul d conside r  them, an d recognize the m immediately an d essentially as Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, or Padmasambhava, or  Amitabha—whichever  the y have been most familiar with. To put it briefly, whichever way you have practiced in life will be the very same way by which you try to recognize the appearances of the bardo of dharmata. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another revealing way of looking at the bardo of dharmata is to see it as duality being expressed in its ultimately purest form. We are presented with the means to liberation, yet we are simultaneously seduced by the call of our habits and instincts. We experience the pure energy of mind, and its confusion at one and the same time. It is almost as if we were being prompted to make up our mind—to choose between one or the other. It goes without saying, however, that whether we even have this choice at all is determined by the degree and perfection of our spiritual practice in life. </p>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre4">EIGHTEEN </b></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Bardo of Becoming </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE EXPERIENCE OF DEATH, for  most people , will simply mean passing into a state of oblivion at the end of the process of dying . The three stages of the inner  dissolution can be as quick, it is sometimes said, as three snaps of a finger. </p>
<p class="calibre2">the white an d red essences of fathe r  an d mother  meet at the heart, an d the black experience called "ful l attainment"  arises. </p>
<p class="calibre2">the Ground Luminosity dawns, bu t we fail to recognize it and we faint into unconsciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As I have said, this is the first failure to recognize, or stage of ignorance, called Ma Rigpa in Tibetan, the opposite of Rigpa. Thi s marks the beginning in us of another  cycle of samsara, which wa s interrupted for  an instant at the moment of death. the bardo of dharmata the n occurs, and it simpl y flashes past, unrecognized. Thi s is the second failure of recognition , a second stag e of ignorance, Ma Rigpa . </p>
<p class="calibre2">the first thing tha t we ar e aware of is "a s if the sky an d earth were separating again": We suddenly awaken into the intermediate state tha t lies between death an d a ne w rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thi s is called the bardo of becoming, the sipa bardo,  an d is the third bardo of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">With our  failure to recognize the Ground Luminosity an d our  failure to recognize the bardo of dharmata, the seeds of all our  habitual tendencies ar e activated an d reawakened. the bardo of becoming spans the time between their reawakening an d our  entering the wom b of the next life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The word sip a in sip a bardo, which is translated as "becoming," also mean s "possibility "  an d "existence. "  In the sipa bardo, as the mind is no longer  limited an d obstructed by the physical body of this world, the "possibilities" are infinite for </p>
<p class="calibre2">"becoming "  reborn in different realms. And thi s bardo ha s the oute r  "existence"  of the mental bod y and the inne r  "existence" </p>
<p class="calibre2">of the mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The outstanding feature of the bardo of becoming is that <i class="calibre3">mind</i> takes on the predominant role, whereas the bardo of dharmata unfolded within the realm of Rigpa. So, in the bardo of dharmata we have a body of light, and in the bardo of becoming we have a mental body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of becoming the mind is endowed with immense clarity and unlimited mobility, yet the direction in which it moves is determined solely by the habitual tendencies of our past karma. So it is called the "karmic" bardo of becoming, because as Kalu Rinpoche says: "It is an entirely automatic or blind result of our previous actions or karma, and nothing that occurs here is a conscious decision on the part of the being; we are simply buffeted around by the force of karma."1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">At this point the mind has arrived at the next stage in its process of gradual unfolding: out of its purest state—the Ground Luminosity—through its light and energy—the appearances of the bardo of dharmata—and so into the yet grosser manifestation of a mental form in the bardo of becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What takes place now at this stage is a reverse process of dissolution: the winds reappear, and along with them come the thought states connected with ignorance, desire, and anger. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, because the memory of our past karmic body is still fresh in our mind, we take on a "mental body." </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MENTAL BODY </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our mental body in the bardo of becoming has a number of special characteristics. It possesses all its senses. It is extremely light, lucid, and mobile, and its awareness is said to be seven times clearer than in life. It is also endowed with a rudimentary kind of clairvoyance, which is not under conscious control, but gives the mental body the ability to read others' minds. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At first this mental body will have a form similar to the body of the He just lived, yet it is without any defects and in the prime of life. Even if you were handicapped or sick in this life, you will have a perfect mental body in the bardo of becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the ancient teachings of Dzogchen tells us that the mental body is about the size of a child of eight to ten years old. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the force of conceptual thinking, also known as </p>
<p class="calibre2">"the karmic wind," the mental body is unable to remain still, even for an instant. It is ceaselessly on the move. It can go wherever it wishes unobstructedly, just by thinking. Because the mental body has no physical basis, it can pass through solid barriers such as walls or mountains.2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The mental body can see through three-dimensional objects. Yet since we lack the father and mother essences of the physical body, we no longer have the light of sun or moon, but only a dim glow illuminating the space immediately in front of us. We can see other bardo beings, but we cannot be seen by living beings, except those who have the kind of clairvoyance developed through deep experience of meditation.3 So we can meet and converse for fleeting moments with many other travelers in the bardo world, those who have died before us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the presence of the five elements in its makeup, the mental body seems to us to be solid, and we still feel pangs of hunger. The bardo teachings say that the mental body lives off odors and derives nourishment from burnt offerings, but it can only benefit from offerings dedicated specially in its name. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In this state mental activity is very rapid: thoughts come in quick succession, and we can do many things at once. The mind continues to perpetuate set patterns and habits, especially its clinging to experiences, and its belief that they are ultimately real. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE EXPERIENCES OF THE BARDO </p>
<p class="calibre2">During the first weeks of the bardo, we have the impression that we are a man or woman, just as in our previous life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We do not realize that we are dead. We return home to meet our family and loved ones. We try to talk to them, to touch them on the shoulder. But they do not reply or even show they are aware we are there. As hard as we try, nothing can make them notice us. We watch, powerless, as they weep or sit stunned and heartbroken over our death. Fruitlessly we try to make use of our belongings. Our place is no longer laid at table, and arrangements are being made to dispose of our possessions. We feel angry, hurt, and frustrated, "like a fish," says the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> "writhing in hot sand." </p>
<p class="calibre2">If we are very attached to our body, we may even try, in vain, to reenter or hover around it. In extreme cases the mental body can linger near its possessions or body for weeks or even years. And still it may not dawn on us we are dead. It is only when we see that we cast no shadow, make no reflection in the mirror, no footprints on the ground, that finally we realize. And the sheer shock of recognizing we have died can be enough to make us faint away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of becoming we relive all the experiences of our past life, reviewing minute details long lost to memory, and revisiting places, the masters say, "where we did no more than spit on the ground." Every seven days we are compelled to go through the experience of death once again, with all its suffering. If our death was peaceful, that peaceful state of mind is repeated; if it was tormented, however, that torment is repeated too. And remember that this is with a consciousness seven times more intense than that of life, and that in the fleeting period of the bardo of becoming, all the negative karma of previous lives is returning, in a fiercely concentrated and deranging way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our restless, solitary wandering through the bardo world is as frantic as a nightmare, and just as in a dream, we believe we have a physical body and that we really exist. Yet all the experiences of this bardo arise only from our mind, created by our karma and habits returning. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The winds of the elements return, and as Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche says, "One hears loud sounds caused by the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. There is the sound of an avalanche continuously falling behind one, the sound of a great rushing river, the sound of a huge blazing mass of fire like a volcano, and the sound of a great storm."4 Trying to escape them in the terrifying darkness, it is said that three different abysses, white, red, and black, "deep and dreadful," </p>
<p class="calibre2">open up in front of us. These, the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> tells us, are our own anger, desire, and ignorance. We are assailed by freezing downpours, hailstorms of pus and blood; haunted by the sound of disembodied, menacing cries; hounded by flesh-eating demons and carnivorous beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We are swept along relentlessly by the wind of karma, unable to hold onto any ground. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says: "At this time, the great tornado of karma, terrifying, unbearable, whirling fiercely, will drive you from behind." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Consumed by fear, blown to and fro like dandelion seeds in the wind, we roam, helpless, through the gloom of the bardo. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tormented by hunger and thirst, we seek refuge here and there. Our mind's perceptions change every moment, projecting us, "like out of a catapult," says the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Dead, </i> into alternate states of sorrow or joy. Into our minds comes the longing for a physical body, and yet we fail to find one, which plunges us into further suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole landscape and environment is molded by our karma, just as the bardo world can be peopled by the night-marish images of our own delusions. If our habitual conduct in life was positive, our perception and experience in the bardo will be mixed with bliss and happiness; and if our lives were harmful or hurtful to others, our experiences in the bardo will be ones of pain, grief, and fear. So, it was said in Tibet, fishermen, butchers, and hunters are attacked by monstrous versions of their former victims. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some who have studied the near-deathexperience in detail, and especially the "life-review" that is one of its common features, have asked themselves: How could we possibly imagine the horror of the bardo experiences of a drug baron, a dictator, or a Nazi torturer? The "life-review" seems to suggest that, after death, we can experience <i class="calibre3"> all</i> the suffering for which we were both directly and indirectly responsible. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE DURATION OF THE BARDO OF BECOMING<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole of the bardo of becoming has an average duration of forty-nine days and a minimum length of one week. But it varies, just as now some people live to be a hundred years old, and others die in their youth. Some can even get stuck in the bardo, to become spirits or ghosts. Dudjom Rinpoche used to explain that during the first twenty-one days of the bardo, you still have a strong impression of your previous life, and this is therefore the most important period for the living to be able to help a dead person. After that, your future life slowly takes shape and becomes the dominant influence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We have to wait in the bardo until we can make a karmic connection with our future parents. I sometimes think of the bardo as something like a transit lounge, in which you can wait for up to forty-nine days before transferring to the next life. But there are two special cases who don't have to wait in the intermediate state, because the intensity of the power of their karma sweeps them immediately on to their next rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The first are those who have lived extremely beneficial and positive lives, and so trained their minds in spiritual practice that the force of their realization carries them directly into a good rebirth. The second case are those whose lives have been negative and harmful; they travel swiftly down to their next birth, wherever that might be. </p>
<p class="calibre2">JUDGMENT </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some accounts of the bardo describe a judgment scene, a kind of life-review similar to the post-mortem judgment found in many of the world's cultures. Your good conscience, a white guardian angel, acts as your defense counsel, recounting the beneficial things you have done, while your bad conscience, a black demon, submits the case for the prosecution. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Good and bad are totalled up as white and black pebbles. The </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Lord of Death," who presides, then consults the mirror of karma and makes his judgment.5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel that in this judgment scene there are some interesting parallels with the life-review of the near-deathexperience.  <i class="calibre3"> Ultimately all judgment takes place within our own mind. We are the judge</i> <i class="calibre3">and the judged. </i> "It is interesting to note," said Raymond Moody, </p>
<p class="calibre2">"that the judgment in the cases I studied came not from the being of light, who seemed to love and accept these people anyway, but rather from within the individual being judged."6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman who went through a near-deathexperience told Kenneth Ring: "You are shown your life—and you do the judging. You are judging yourself. You have been forgiven all your sins, but are you able to forgive yourself for not doing the things you should have done, and some little cheating things that maybe you've done in life? Can you forgive yourself? </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the judgment."7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The judgment scene also shows that what really counts, in the final analysis, is the motivation behind our every action, and that there is no escaping the effects of our past actions, words, and thoughts and the imprints and habits they have stamped us with. It means that we are entirely responsible, not only for this life, but for our future lives as well. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE POWER OF THE MIND<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">As our mind is so light, mobile, and vulnerable in the bardo, whatever thoughts arise, good or bad, have tremendous power and influence. Without a physical body to ground us, thoughts actually become reality. Imagine the sharp grief and anger we might feel on seeing a funeral service performed carelessly on our behalf, or greedy relatives squabbling over our possessions, or friends we loved deeply, and thought had loved us, talking about us in a sneering or hurtful or simply condescending way. Such a situation could be very dangerous, because our reaction, in its violence, could drive us directly toward an unfortunate rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The overwhelming power of thought, then, is <i class="calibre3"> the</i> key issue in the bardo of becoming. This crucial moment finds us completely exposed to whatever habits and tendencies we have allowed to grow and dominate our lives. If you don't check those habits and tendencies now in life, and prevent them from seizing hold of your mind, then in the bardo of becoming you will be their helpless victim, buffeted to and fro by their power. The slightest irritation, for example, in the bardo of becoming can have a devastating effect, and that is why traditionally the person reading the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> had to be someone with whom you had a good connection; if not, the very sound of his or her voice could infuriate you, with the most disastrous consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The teachings give us many descriptions of the rawness of the mind in the bardo of becoming; the most striking of these says that our mind in this bardo is like a flaming red-hot iron bar that can be bent in whichever way you want until it cools, when whatever form it finds itself in rapidly solidifies. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In just the same way, it is said, a single positive thought in this bardo can lead directly to enlightenment, and a single negative reaction can plunge you into the most prolonged and extreme suffering. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> could not warn us more strongly: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now is the time which is the borderline between going up and</i> <i class="calibre3">going down; now is the time when by slipping into laziness even</i> <i class="calibre3">for a moment you will endure constant suffering; now is the time</i> <i class="calibre3">when by concentrating for an instant you will enjoy constant happiness. Focus your mind single-mindedly; strive to prolong the</i> <i class="calibre3">results of good karma! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> tries to awaken any connection with spiritual practice the dead person may have had, and it encourages us: to give up attachment to people and possessions, to abandon yearning for a body, not to give in to desire or anger, to cultivate kindness rather than hostility, and not even to contemplate negative actions. It reminds the dead person there is no need to fear: On the one hand, it tells them that the terrifying bardo figures are nothing more than their own deluded projections and by nature empty; and on the other hand, that they themselves have only "a mental body of habitual tendencies," and are therefore empty too. "So emptiness cannot harm emptiness." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The shifting and precarious nature of the bardo of becoming can also be the source of many opportunities for liberation, and the susceptibility of mind in this bardo can be turned to our advantage. All we have to do is remember one instruction; all it needs is for one positive thought to spring into our mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If we can recall any teaching that has inspired us to the nature of mind, if we have even one good inclination toward practice, or a deep connection with a spiritual practice, then that alone can free us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of becoming, the buddha realms do not appear spontaneously as they do in the bardo of dharmata. Just by remembering them, however, you can transfer yourself there directly by the power of your mind, and proceed toward enlightenment. It is said that if you can invoke a buddha, he will immediately appear before you. But remember, even though the possibilities are limitless, we must have at least some, if not total, control over our mind in this bardo; and this is extremely difficult, because the mind here is so vulnerable, fragmented, and restless. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So in this bardo, whenever you can suddenly retrieve your awareness, even for a moment, immediately recall your connection with spiritual practice, remember your master or buddha, and invoke them with all your strength. If in life you have developed the natural reflex of praying whenever things become difficult or critical, or slip beyond your control, then instandy you will be able to invoke or call to mind an enlightened being, such as Buddha or Padmasambhava, Tara or Avalokiteshvara, Christ or the Virgin Mary. If you are able to invoke them fervendy with one-pointed devotion, and with all your heart, then dirough the power of their blessing, your mind will be liberated into the space of their wisdom mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Prayer in this life may seem sometimes to bring little result, but its effects in the bardo are unprecedentedly powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet the description I have given you of the bardo shows the sheer difficulty of focusing the mind at this juncture, if we have had no previous training. Think how almost impossible it is to remember something like a prayer in a dream or nightmare, how impotent and powerless we feel in them; in the bardo of becoming it is just as hard, if not harder, to collect our thoughts at all. This is why the watchword of the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan</i> <i class="calibre3">Book of the Dead, </i> repeated over and over again, is: "Do not be distracted." As it points out: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">This is the dividing line where buddhas and sentient beings are</i> <i class="calibre3">separated. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">"In an instant they are separated, in an instant complete enlightenment." </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">REBIRTH </p>
<p class="calibre2">As, in the bardo of becoming, the time for rebirth gets closer, you crave more and more the support of a material body, and you search for any one that might be available in which to be reborn. Different signs begin to appear, warning you of the realm in which you are likely to take rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Lights of various colors shine from the six realms of existence, and you will feel drawn toward one or another, depending on the negative emotion that is predominant in your mind. Once you have been drawn into one of these lights, it is very difficult to turn back. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then images and visions will arise, linked to the different realms. As you become more familiar with the teachings, you will become more alert to what they really mean. The signs vary slightly according to different teachings. Some say that if you are to be reborn as a god, you will have a vision of entering a heavenly palace with many stories. If you are to be reborn as a demigod, you will feel you are amidst spinning cir-cular weapons of fire, or going onto a battlefield. If you are to be reborn as an animal, you find yourself in a cave, a hole in the ground, or a nest made of straw. If you have a vision of a tree stump, a deep forest, or a woven cloth, you are to be reborn as a hungry ghost. And if you are to be reborn in hell, you will feel you are being led, powerless, into a black pit, down a black road, into a somber land with black or red houses, or toward a city of iron. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are many other signs, such as the way in which your gaze or movement is aligned, which indicate the realm for which you are heading. If you are to be reborn in a god or human realm, your gaze will be directed upward; if in an animal realm, you will look straight ahead, as do birds; and if in a hungry ghost or hell realm, you will be facing downward, as though you were diving. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If any of these signs appear, you should be on guard not to fall into any of these unfortunate rebirths. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, you will have an intense desire and longing for certain realms, and you are drawn toward them all too instinctively. The teachings warn us that at this point there is a great danger that out of your avid eagerness to be reborn, you will rush to any place at all that seems to offer some security. If your desire is frustrated, the anger that arises will of itself bring the bardo abruptly to an end, as you are swept into your next rebirth by the current of that negative emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, as you can see, your future rebirth is directly determined by desire, anger, and ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine that you run toward a place of refuge, simply to escape the onslaught of the bardo experiences. Then, terrified to leave, you might become attached and take on a new birth, no matter where, just in order to have one. You might even, the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> explains, become confused and mistake a good birthplace for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one. Or hear the voices of your loved ones calling you, or seductive singing, and follow these, only to find yourself being lured down into the lower realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You must take great care not to enter blindly into one of these undesirable realms. Yet what is wonderful is that the instant you become aware of what is happening to you, you can actually begin to influence and change your destiny. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Swept along by the wind of karma, you will then arrive at a place where your future parents are making love. Seeing them, you become emotionally drawn in; and because of past karmic connections, you begin spontaneously to feel strong attachment or aversion. Attraction and desire for the mother and aversion or jealousy for the father will result in your being born as a male child, and the reverse a female.8 But if you succumb to such strong passions, not only will you be reborn, but that very emotion may draw you into birth in a lower realm. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there anything now that we can do to avoid being reborn or to direct our next rebirth? The bardo teachings give two specific kinds of instructions: methods for preventing a rebirth, or failing that, for choosing a good birth. First are the guidelines for <i class="calibre3"> closing the entrance to another birth:</i> The best method is to abandon the emotions such as desire, anger, or jealousy, and recognize that none of these bardo experiences have any ultimate reality. If you can realize this and then rest the mind in its true, empty nature, this in itself will prevent rebirth. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> here warns us: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Alas! the father and mother, the great storm, the whirlwind, the</i> <i class="calibre3">thunder, the terrifying projections and all these apparent phenomena are illusory in their real nature. However they appear, they are</i> <i class="calibre3">not real. All substances are false and untrue. They are like a</i> <i class="calibre3">mirage, they are not permanent, they are not changeless. What is</i> <i class="calibre3">the use of desire? What is the use of fear? It is regarding the</i> <i class="calibre3">nonexistent as existent. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> goes on to advise us: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"All substances are my own mind, and this mind is emptiness, unarisen and unobstructed."  <i class="calibre3"> Thinking this, keep your</i> <i class="calibre3">mind natural and undiluted, self-contained in its own nature like</i> <i class="calibre3">water poured into water, just as it is, loose, open and relaxed. By</i> <i class="calibre3">letting it rest naturally and loosely, you can be sure that the womb-entrance to all the different kinds of birth will certainly be closed.9 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The next best method to prevent rebirth is to see your potential parents as the buddha, or your master, or yidam deity. And at the very least, you should try to generate a feeling of renunciation against being drawn into feelings of desire, and to think of the pure realms of the buddhas. This will prevent rebirth and may cause you to be reborn in one of the buddha realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you are unable to stabilize the mind enough to do even this kind of practice, then there remain the methods for <i class="calibre3"> choosing a rebirth, </i> which are linked to the landmarks and signs of the different realms. If you must take rebirth, or you intentionally wish to be reborn in order to pursue your spiritual path and be of benefit to others, you should not enter any but the human realm. It is only there that conditions are favorable for spiritual progress. If you are going to be born in a fortunate situation in the human realm, the teachings tell us, you will feel you are arriving at a sumptuous and beautiful house, or in a city, or among a crowd of people, or you will have a vision of couples making love. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, generally we have no choice. We are drawn toward our birthplace "as inexorably as a bird lured into a cage, dry grass catching fire, or an animal sinking into a marsh." The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says: "O son/daughter of an enlightened family, even though you do not want to go, you have no power of your own; you are helpless and compelled to go." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, as the teachings are always so inspiringly reminding us, there is always hope;  <i class="calibre3"> now</i> is the time for prayer. By wishing and concentrating intensely, even at this moment, you can still be reborn in one of the buddha realms, or else you can generate a deep aspiration to be reborn in a human family where you may be able to meet the spiritual path and continue toward liberation. If you have a strong karma that impels you toward a particular realm, you may have no choice; however, your past aspiration and prayers can help you to reshape your destiny, so you may be reborn into a life that will lead one day to liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even as you enter the womb, you can go on praying for this to happen. Even now, you can visualize yourself as any enlightened being, traditionally the masters say as Vajrasattva,10 bless the womb you are entering as a sacred environment, "a palace of the gods," and continue to practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now when the bar do of becoming dawns upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will concentrate my mind one-pointedly,</i> <i class="calibre3">And strive to prolong the results of good karma,</i> <i class="calibre3">Close the entrance to rebirth, and try to keep from being reborn. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">This is the time when perseverance and pure perception are</i> <i class="calibre3">needed; </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Abandon negative emotions, and meditate on the master. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ultimately it is the mind's urge to inhabit a particular realm that impels us toward reincarnation, and its tendency to solidify and to grasp that finds its ultimate expression in physical rebirth. This is the next stage in the process of manifestation that we have seen taking place throughout the bardos. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you succeed in directing the mind toward a human birth, you have come full circle. You are poised to be born again into the natural bardo of this life. When you see your father and mother in intercourse, your mind is ineluctably drawn in, and enters the womb. This signals the end of the bardo of becoming, as your mind rapidly reexperiences yet again the signs of the phases of dissolution and the dawning of the Ground Luminosity. Then the black experience of full attainment arises again, and at the same moment the connection to the new womb is made. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So life begins, as it ends, with the Ground Luminosity. </p>

<p class="calibre2">NINETEEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Helping After Death </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">SO OFTEN IN THE MODERN WORLD when someone </p>
<p class="calibre2">dies, one of the deepest sources of anguish for those left behind to mourn is their conviction that there is nothing they can now do to help their loved one who has gone, a conviction that only aggravates and darkens the loneliness of their grief. But this is not true. There are many, many ways we can help the dead, and so help ourselves to survive their absence. One of the unique features of Buddhism, and one of the ways in which the omniscient skill and compassion of the buddhas is most profoundly demonstrated, is in the many special practices available to help a dead person, and so also comfort the bereaved. The Tibetan Buddhist vision of life and death is an all-encompassing one, and it shows us clearly that there are ways of helping people in every conceivable situation, since there are no barriers whatever between what we call "life" and what we call "death." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The radiant power and warmth of the compassionate heart can reach out to help in all states and all realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">WHEN WE CAN HELP </p>
<p class="calibre2">The bardo of becoming, as it has already been described, may seem a very disturbed and disturbing time. Yet there is great hope in it. The qualities of the mental body during the bardo of becoming that make it so vulnerable—its clarity, mobility, sensitivity, and clairvoyance— <i class="calibre3">also make it particularly</i> <i class="calibre3">receptive to help from the living. </i> The fact that it has no physical form or basis makes it very easy to guide. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of</i> <i class="calibre3">the Dead</i> compares the mental body to a horse, which can be readily controlled by a bridle, or to a huge tree trunk, which may be almost immovable on land, yet once floated in water can be effortlessly directed wherever you wish. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The most powerful time to do spiritual practice for someone who has died is during the forty-nine days of the bardo of becoming, placing special emphasis on the first twenty-one days. It is during these first three weeks that the dead have a stronger link with <i class="calibre3"> this</i> life, which makes them more accessible to our help. So it is then that spiritual practice has a far greater possibility of influencing their future, and of affecting their chances for liberation, or at least a better rebirth. We should employ every means possible to help them then, as after the physical form of their next existence begins gradually to be determined—and this is said to happen between the twenty-first and forty-ninth day after death—the chance for real change is very much more limited. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Help for the dead, however, is not confined to the forty-nine days after death.  <i class="calibre3"> It is never too late to help someone who has</i> <i class="calibre3">died, no matter how long ago it was. </i> The person you want to help may have been dead a hundred years, but it will still be of benefit to practice for them. Dudjom Rinpoche used to say that even if someone has gained enlightenment and become a buddha, they will still need all the assistance they can possibly get in their work of helping others. </p>
<p class="calibre2">HOW WE CAN HELP<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The best and easiest way to help a dead person is to do the essential practice of phowa I have taught in Chapter 13, "Spiritual Help for the Dying," as soon as we hear that someone has died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet we say that just as it is the nature of fire to burn and of water to quench thirst, the nature of the buddhas is to be present as soon as anyone invokes them, so infinite is their compassionate desire to help all sentient beings. Don't for one moment imagine that it would be less effective for <i class="calibre3"> you</i> to invoke the truth to help your dead friend than if a "holy man" </p>
<p class="calibre2">prays for them. Because you are close to the person who has died, the intensity of your love and the depth of your connection will give your invocation an added power. The masters have assured us: Call out to them, and the buddhas <i class="calibre3"> will</i> answer you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Khandro Tsering Chodron, the spiritual wife of Jamyang Khyentse, often says that if you really have a good heart, and really mean well, and then pray for someone, that prayer will be very effective. So be confident that if someone you love very much has died, and you pray for them with true love and sincerity, your prayer <i class="calibre3"> will</i> be exceptionally powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The best and most effective time to do the phowa is before the body is touched or moved in any way. If this is not possible, then try to do the phowa in the place where the person died, or at least picture that place very strongly in your mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a powerful connection between the dead person, the place of death, and also the time of death, especially in the case of a person who died in a traumatic way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of becoming, as I have said, the dead person's consciousness goes through the experience of deathevery week, on exactly the same day. So you should perform the phowa, or whatever other spiritual practice you have chosen to do, on any day of the forty-nine-day period, but <i class="calibre3"> especially</i> on the same day of the week that the person died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whenever your dead relative or friend comes into your mind, whenever you hear his or her name being mentioned, send the person your love, then focus on doing the phowa, and do it for as long and as often as you wish. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another thing you can do, whenever you think of someone who has died, is to say immediately a mantra such as OM </p>
<p class="calibre2">MANI PADME HUM (pronounced by Tibetans: Om Mani Peme Hung), the mantra of the Buddha of Compassion, which purifies each of the negative emotions that are the cause of rebirth;1 or OM AMI DEWA HRIH, the mantra of Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless Light. You can then follow that again with the practice of phowa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But whether you do any of these practices or not to help your loved one who has died, don't ever forget that the consciousness in the bardo is acutely clairvoyant; simply directing good thoughts toward them will be most beneficial. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you pray for someone who was close to you, you can, if you wish, extend the embrace of your compassion to include other dead people in your prayers: the victims of atrocities, wars, disasters, and famines, or those who died and are now dying in concentration camps, such as those in China and Tibet. You can even pray for people who died years ago, like your grandparents, long-dead members of your family, or victims of wars, such as those in the World Wars. Imagine your prayers going especially to those who lost their lives in extreme anguish, passion, or anger. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who have suffered <i class="calibre3"> violent or sudden death</i> have a particularly urgent need for help. Victims of murder, suicide, accident, or war can easily be trapped by their suffering, anguish, and fear, or may be imprisoned in the actual experience of death and so be unable to move on through the process of rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you practice the phowa for them, do it more strongly and with more fervor than you have ever done it before: Imagine tremendous rays of light emanating from the buddhas or divine beings, pouring down all their compassion and blessing. Imagine this light streaming down onto the dead person, totally purifying and freeing them from the confusion and pain of their death, granting them profound, lasting peace. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine then, with all your heart and mind, that the dead person dissolves into light and his or her consciousness, healed now and free of all suffering, soars up to merge indissolubly, and forever, with the wisdom mind of the buddhas. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some Western people who recently visited Tibet told me about the following incident they had witnessed. One day a Tibetan walking by the side of the road was knocked over and killed instantly by a Chinese truck. A monk, who happened to be passing, quickly went over and sat next to the dead man lying on the ground. They saw the monk lean over him and recite some practice or other close to his ear; suddenly, to their astonishment, the dead man revived. The monk then performed a practice they recognized as the transference of consciousness, and guided him back calmly into death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What had happened? Clearly the monk had recognized that the violent shock of the man's death had left him terribly disturbed, and so the monk had acted swiftly: first to free the dead man's mind from its distress, and then, by means of the phowa, to transfer it to a buddha realm or toward a good rebirth. To the Westerners who were watching, this monk seemed to be just an ordinary person, but this remarkable story shows that he was in fact a practitioner of considerable power. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Meditation practices and prayers are not the only kind of help we can give to the dead. We can offer charity in their name to help the sick and needy. We can give their possessions to the poor. We can contribute, on their behalf, to humanitarian or spiritual ventures such as hospitals, aid projects, hospices, or monasteries. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We could also sponsor retreats by good spiritual practitioners, or prayer meetings led by great masters in sacred places, like Bodhgaya. We could offer lights for the dead person, or sponsor works of art related to spiritual practice. Another method of helping the dead, especially favored in Tibet and the Himalayas, is to save the lives of animals due to be slaughtered, and release them again into freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is important to dedicate all the merit and well-being that spring from any such acts of kindness and generosity to the dead person, and in fact to all those who have died, so that everyone who has died may obtain a better rebirth and favorable circumstances in their next life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE CLAIRVOYANCE OF THE DEAD PERSON </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember, the clairvoyant consciousness of the person in the bardo of becoming is seven times clearer than in life. This can bring them <i class="calibre3"> either great suffering or great benefit. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is essential that after someone you love has died, you are as aware as possible in all your behavior, so as not to disturb or hurt them. For when the dead person returns to those left behind, or those invited to practice on their behalf, they are able, in their new state of being, not only to see what is going on but to read minds direcdy. If relatives are only scheming and quarreling about how to divide up their possessions, only talking and thinking of attachment and aversion, with no real love for the dead person, this can cause them intense anger and hurt or disillusion, and they will then be drawn by these turbulent emotions into an unfortunate rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, imagine if a dead person saw spiritual practitioners supposedly practicing for him but with no sincere thought in their minds for his benefit, and with their minds preoccupied with trivial distractions; the dead person could lose any faith he might ever have had. Imagine too if a dead person had to watch her loved ones distraught and helpless with grief; it could plunge her into deep grief also. And if a dead person were to discover, for example, that relatives only made a show of loving her because of her money, she could become so painfully disillusioned that she returned as a ghost to haunt the inheritor of her wealth. You can see now that what you do and how you think and how you behave after people have died can be of crucial importance, and have a far greater impact on their future than you can possibly imagine.2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">You will see now why it is absolutely essential for the peace of mind of the dead person that those who are left behind should be harmonious. This is why, in Tibet, when all the friends and relatives of the dead person assembled, they were encouraged to practice together  an d to say, as muc h as possible , a mantra such as: OM MANI PADME HUM . Thi s is something tha t everyone in Tibet  could do an d knew would definitely help the dead person , and which inspired the m all to an act of fervent communal prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The clairvoyance of the dead person in the bardo of becoming is also wha t make s the practice done by a master or experienced spiritual practitioner  on his or  her  behal f of such exceptional benefit . </p>
<p class="calibre2">What a master  does is to rest in the primordial state of Rigpa, the nature of mind, and invoke the mental body of the dead person roaming in the bardo of becoming. When the mental bod y comes int o the master's presence, through the power of meditation, he or she can point out the essential nature of Rigpa. Through the power  of its clairvoyance, the bardo being then can see directly int o the master's wisdom mind, an d so there an d the n be introduced to the nature of mind an d be liberated. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever practice an ordinary practitioner can do as well for  a close friend  wh o ha s died can, for  the sam e reason, be of enormous help . You migh t do the practice, for  example, of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities associated with the <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, or  you migh t simpl y rest in a steady state of compassion; especiall y if you the n invok e the dead person an d invit e him or  her  int o the heart-core of your  practice, it can be of immense benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whenever Buddhist practitioners die we infor m their  master, all their spiritual teachers, and their spiritual friends , so the y can immediately start practicing for  them. Usuall y I collect the names of peopl e wh o hav e died , and send the m to grea t masters I kno w in Indi a and the Himalayas. Ever y few weeks the y will include the m in a purification practice, and once a year  in a ten-day intensive group practice in the monasteries. 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">TIBETA N BUDDHIS T PRACTICE S FO R the DEA D </p>
<p class="calibre2">1. The  <i class="calibre3">Tibetan  Book of the Dea d</i> </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet, once the phowa practice ha s been done for  the dying person, the  <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is read repeatedly and the practices associated with it ar e done . In eastern Tibet we used to hav e a tradition of reading the  <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book  of the</i>  </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Dead</i> for the whole forty-nine days after death. Through the reading, the dead are shown what stage of the process of death they are in, and given whatever inspiration and guidance they need. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Westerners often ask me: How can a person who is dead <i class="calibre3">hear</i> the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The simple reply is that the consciousness of the dead person, when it is invoked by the power of prayer, is able to read our minds and can feel exactly whatever we may be thinking or meditating on. That is why there is no obstacle to the dead person's understanding the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> or practices done on their behalf, even though they may be recited in Tibetan. For the dead person, language is no barrier at all, for the essential <i class="calibre3"> meaning</i> of the text can be understood fully and directly by his or her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This makes it all the more vital that the practitioner should be as focused and attentive as possible when doing the practice, and not merely performing it by rote. Also, as the dead person is living the actual experiences, he or she may have a greater capacity to understand the truth of the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of</i> <i class="calibre3">the Dead</i> than we do! </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am sometimes asked: "But what happens if the consciousness has already fainted into an oblivious state at the moment of death?" Since we do not know how long the dead person will remain in that state of unconsciousness, and at what point he or she will enter the bardo of becoming, the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of</i> <i class="calibre3">the Dead</i> is read and practiced repeatedly, to cover any eventuality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But what about people who are not familiar with the teachings or the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead:</i> Should we read it to them? The Dalai Lama has given us this clear guidance: <i class="calibre3">Whether you believe in religion or not it is very important to have a</i> <i class="calibre3">peaceful mind at the time of death. From a Buddhist point of</i> <i class="calibre3">view, whether the person who dies believes in rebirth or not, their</i> <i class="calibre3">rebirthexists, and so a peaceful mind, even if it is neutral, is important at the time of death. If the person is a non-believer, reading the</i> Tibetan Book of the Dead <i class="calibre3"> could agitate their mind... it could</i> <i class="calibre3">arouse aversion and so even harm them instead of helping them. In</i> <i class="calibre3">the case of a person who is open to it, however, the mantras or the</i> <i class="calibre3">names of the buddhas might help them to generate some kind of</i> <i class="calibre3">connection, and so it could be helpful. It is important to take into</i> <i class="calibre3">account, above all, the attitude of the dying person.4 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Ne Dren and Chang Chok </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hand in hand with the reading of the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the</i> <i class="calibre3">Dead</i> goes the practice of <i class="calibre3"> Ne Dren, </i> the ritual for guiding the dead, or <i class="calibre3"> Chang Chok, </i> the ritual purification, in which a master will guide the consciousness of the dead person to a better rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ideally, the Ne Dren or Chang Chok should be done immediately after death, or at least within forty-nine days. If the corpse is not present, the consciousness of the deceased is summoned into an effigy or card bearing the likeness and name, or even a photograph, called a <i class="calibre3"> tsenjang. </i> The Ne Dren and Chang Chok derive their power from the fact that during the period immediately after death, the dead person will have a strong feeling of possessing the body of its recent life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Through the power of the master's meditation, the consciousness of the dead person, roaming aimlessly in the bardo, is called into the tsenjang, which represents the dead person's identity. The consciousness is then purified; the karmic seeds of the six realms are cleansed; a teaching is given just as in life; and the dead person is introduced to the nature of the mind. Finally the phowa is effected, and the dead person's consciousness is directed toward one of the buddha realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then the tsenjang, representing the individual's old—now discarded—identity, is burned, and their karma is purified. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3.  <i class="calibre3"> The Purification of the Six Realms </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">My master Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche often used to say that the practice known as the "Purification of the Six Realms" was the best possible purification practice for a practitioner who has died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Purification of the Six Realms is a practice used in life that employs visualization and meditation to purify the body of each of the six main negative emotions, along with the realms of existence they create. It can also be used very effectively for the dead, and is particularly powerful because it purifies the root of their karma, and so of their connection with samsara. This is essential; if these negative emotions are not purified, they will dictate which realm of samsara the dead person will be reborn in. </p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the Dzogchen Tantras, the negative emotions accumulate in the psycho-physical system of subtle channels, inner air, and energy, and gather at particular energy centers in the body. So the seed of the hell realm and its cause, anger, are located at the soles of the feet; the hungry ghost realm and its cause, avarice, rest at the base of the trunk; the animal realm and its cause, ignorance, rest at the navel; the human realm and its cause, doubt, rest at the heart; the demigod realm and its cause, jealousy, rest at the throat; and the god realm and its cause, pride, rest at the crown of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In this practice of the Purification of the Six Realms, when each realm and its negative emotion is purified, the practitioner imagines that all the karma created by that particular emotion is now exhausted, and that the specific part of his body associated with the karma of a particular emotion dissolves entirely into light. So when you do this practice for a dead person, imagine with all your heart and mind that, at the end of the practice, all their karma is purified, and their body and entire being dissolve into radiant light.5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">4 <i class="calibre3">. The Practice of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities</i> Another means to help the dead is the practice of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities. (These deities are described in Chapter 17, "Intrinsic Radiance.") The practitioner considers his or her entire body as the mandala of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities; the peaceful deities are visualized in the energy center in the heart, and the wrathful deities in the brain. The practitioner then imagines that the deities send out thousands of rays of light, which stream out to the dead and purify all their negative karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The mantra of purification the practitioner recites is the mantra of Vajrasattva, the presiding deity of all the Tantric mandalas, and the central deity of the mandala of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities, whose power is invoked especially for purification and for healing. This is the "Hundred Syllable Mantra," which includes "seed syllables" of each of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities.6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">You can use a short, six-syllable form of the Vajrasattva mantra: OM VAJRA SATTVA HUM (pronounced by Tibetans: Om Benza Satto Hung). The essential meaning of this mantra is, "O Vajrasattva! Through your power may you bring about purification, healing, and transformation." I strongly recommend this mantra for healing and purification. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another important mantra, which appears in the Dzogchen Tantras and the practices associated with the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of</i> <i class="calibre3">the Dead, </i> is 'A A HA SHA SA MA. The six syllables of this mantra have the power to "close the gates" to the six realms of samsara. </p>
<p class="calibre2">5.  <i class="calibre3"> Cremation </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Generally in many Eastern traditions,  <i class="calibre3"> cremation</i> is the way of disposing of the corpse. In Tibetan Buddhism, there are also specific practices for cremation. The crematorium or funeral pyre is visualized as the mandala of Vajrasattva, or the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities, and the deities are strongly visualized and their presence is invoked. The dead person's corpse is seen as actually representing all his or her negative karma and obscurations. As the corpse burns, these are consumed by the deities as a great feast and transmuted and transformed by them into their wisdom nature. Rays of light are imagined streaming out from the deities; the corpse is visualized dissolving completely into light, as all the impurities of the dead person are purified in the blazing flames of wisdom. As you visualize this, you can recite the hundred-syllable or six-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva. This simple practice for a cremation was transmitted and inspired by Dudjom Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The ashes of the body, and the tsenjang, can then be mixed with clay to make little images called <i class="calibre3"> tsatsa. </i> These are blessed and dedicated on behalf of the dead person, so creating auspicious conditions for a future good rebirth. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">6. The Weekly Practices </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In a Tibetan environment practices and rituals happen regularly every seventh day after death, or if the family can afford it, for each of the forty-nine days. Monks are invited to do practice, especially the Lamas who are close to the family and had a link with the dead person. Lights are offered and prayers said continuously, especially until the time the body is taken out of the house. Offerings are made to masters and to shrines, and alms are given to the poor in the name of the dead person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">These "weekly" practices on behalf of the dead person are considered essential, since the mental body in the bardo of becoming undergoes every week, on the same day, the experience of death. If the dead person has enough merit as a result of positive actions in the past, then the benefit of these practices can give him or her the impetus to transfer to a pure realm. Strictly speaking, if a person passed away on a Wednesday before noon, the first week's practice day would fall on the following Tuesday. If the person died after noon, it would fall on the following Wednesday. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tibetans regard the fourth week after death as especially significant, because some say that most ordinary beings do not stay in the bardo longer than four weeks. The seventh week is also considered a critical juncture, as forty-nine days is taught to be generally the longest stay in the bardo. So on these occa-sions, masters and practitioners will be invited to the house, and the practices, offerings, and donations to the needy are performed on a grander scale. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another offering ceremony and feast is held one year after the death, to mark the dead person's rebirth. Most Tibetan families have annual ceremonies on the anniversaries of their teachers, parents, husbands, wives, brothers, and sisters, and on these days they will also give donations to the poor. </p>
<p class="calibre2">HELPING THE BEREAVED </p>
<p class="calibre2">Among Tibetans, whenever someone dies it's natural for relatives and friends to gather round, and everyone always finds some way or another to give a helping hand. The whole community provides strong spiritual, emotional, and practical support, and the dead person's family is never left feeling helpless or at a loss or wondering what they can do. Everyone in Tibetan society knows that as much as possible is being done for the dead person, and that knowledge empowers those who are left behind to endure, accept, and survive the death of their loved ones. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How different it is now in modern society, where such community support has been almost entirely lost! I often think how such support could save the grief of bereavement from being prolonged and needlessly difficult, as it so often is. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My students who work as bereavement counselors in hospices have told me that one of the severest sources of anguish for the bereaved person is the belief that neither they nor anyone else can do anything for their loved one who has died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But there is, as I have been showing, a great deal that anyone can do to help the dead. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One way of comforting the bereaved is to encourage them to do something for their loved ones who have died: by living even more intensely on their behalf after they have gone, by practicing for them, and so giving their death a deeper meaning. In Tibet relatives may even go on a pilgrimage for the dead person, and at special moments and at holy places they will think of their dead loved ones and practice for them. The Tibetans never forget the dead: They will make offerings at shrines on their behalf; at great prayer meetings they will sponsor prayers in their name; they will keep making donations, for them, to spiritual projects; and whenever they meet masters they will request special prayers for them. The greatest consolation for a Tibetan would be to know that a master was doing practice for their dead relative. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't let us half die with our loved ones, then; let us try to live, after they have gone, with greater fervor. Let us try, at least, to fulfill the dead person's wishes or aspirations in some way, for instance by giving some of his belongings to charity, or sponsoring in her name a project she held particularly dear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tibetans often write letters of condolence to friends who are bereaved that might say something like this: <i class="calibre3">All things are impermanent, and all things die. You know this. It</i> <i class="calibre3">was only natural that your mother died when she did; the older</i> <i class="calibre3">generation is expected to die first. She was elderly and unwell, and</i> <i class="calibre3">will not resent having had to leave her body. And because you can</i> <i class="calibre3">help her now by sponsoring practices and doing good actions in her</i> <i class="calibre3">name, she will be happy and relieved. So please do not be sad. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">If our friend has lost a child or someone close to them who seemed too young to die so soon, we tell them: <i class="calibre3">Now your little boy has died, and it seems as if your whole world</i> <i class="calibre3">has been shattered. It seems, I know, so cruel and illogical. I cannot explain your son's death, but I do know that it must be the</i> <i class="calibre3">natural result of his karma, and I believe and know that his death</i> <i class="calibre3">must have purified some karmic debt that you and I cannot know</i> <i class="calibre3">about Your grief is my grief. But take heart because now you and</i> <i class="calibre3">I can help him, through our practice and our good actions and our</i> <i class="calibre3">love; we can take his hand and walk by his side, even now, even</i> <i class="calibre3">when he's dead, and help him to find a new birth and a longer</i> <i class="calibre3">life next time. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In other cases we might write: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I know your grief is vast, but when you are tempted to despair,</i> <i class="calibre3">just think how fortunate your friend is to have the masters practicing for her. just think too, that at other times and in other places</i> <i class="calibre3">there has been no such spiritual help at all for those who died. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Think, when you remember your loved one dying, how many</i> <i class="calibre3">people are dying in the world today, alone, forgotten, abandoned,</i> <i class="calibre3">and unsupported by any spiritual vision. Think of the people who</i> <i class="calibre3">died in the terrible, inhuman years of the Cultural Revolution in</i> <i class="calibre3">Tibet, where spiritual practice of any kind was forbidden. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Remember too, when despair menaces you that giving in to it</i> <i class="calibre3">will only disturb the one who has died. Your sorrow may even</i> <i class="calibre3">drag her back from the path she may be taking toward a good</i> <i class="calibre3">rebirth. And if you are consumed by grief you will cripple yourself</i> <i class="calibre3">from being able to help her. The steadier you are, the more positive</i> <i class="calibre3">your state of mind, the more comfort you will give her, and the</i> <i class="calibre3">more you will enable her to free herself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">When you are sad, have the courage to say to yourself: "Whatever feelings I am experiencing, they will all pass: even if they</i> <i class="calibre3">return, they cannot last" Just as long as you do not try to prolong</i> <i class="calibre3">them, all your feelings of loss and grief will naturally begin to dissolve and fall away. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In our world, however, where we do not know that it is even possible to help the dead, and where we have not faced the fact of death at all, such a serene and wise reflection cannot be easy. A person who is going through bereavement for the first time may simply be shattered by the array of disturbing feelings, of intense sadness, anger, denial, withdrawal, and guilt that they suddenly find are playing havoc inside them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Helping those who have just gone through the loss of someone close to them will call for all your patience and sensitivity. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You will need to spend time with them and to let them talk, to listen silently without judgment as they recall their most private memories, or go over again and again the details of the death. Above all, you will need simply to be there with them as they experience what is probably the fiercest sadness and pain of their entire lives. Make sure you make yourself available to them at all times, even when they don't seem to need it. Carol, a widow, was interviewed for a video series on death one year after her husband had died. "When you look back on the last year," she was asked, "who would you say had helped you the most?" She said: "The people who kept calling and coming by, even though I said 'no.'" </p>
<p class="calibre2">People who are grieving go through a kind of death. Just like a person who is actually dying, they need to know that the disturbing emotions they are feeling are natural. They need to know too that the process of mourning is a long and often tortuous one, where grief returns again and again in cycles. Their shock and numbness and disbelief will fade, and will be replaced by a deep and at times desperate awareness of the immensity of their loss, which itself will settle eventually into a state of recovery and balance. Tell them this is a pattern that will repeat itself over and over again, month after  month, and that all their unbearable feelings and fears, of being unable to function as a human being any more, are normal. Tell them that although it may take one year or two, their grief will definitely reach an end and be transformed into acceptance. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As Judy Tatelbaum says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Grief is a wound that needs attention in order to heal. To work</i> <i class="calibre3">through and complete grief means to face our feelings openly and</i> <i class="calibre3">honestly, to express and release our feelings fully and to tolerate</i> <i class="calibre3">and accept our feelings for however long it takes for the wound to</i> <i class="calibre3">heal. We fear that once acknowledged grief will bowl us over. The</i> <i class="calibre3">truth is that grief experienced does dissolve. Grief unexpressed is</i> <i class="calibre3">grief that lasts indefinitely.7 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">But so often, tragically, friends and family of the bereaved expect them to be "back to normal" after a few months. This only intensifies their bewilderment and isolation as their grief continues, and sometimes even deepens. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet, as I've said, the whole community, friends and relatives, would take part during the forty-nine days after the death, and everyone was fully occupied in the activity of the spiritual help being given to the dead person, with all the hundred things there were to do. The bereaved would grieve, and they would cry a little, as is only natural, and then when everyone had left, the house would look empty. Yet in so many subtle, heartwarming ways, the bustle and support of those forty-nine days had helped them through a great part of their mourning. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing loss alone in our society is very different. And all the usual feelings of grief are magnified intensely in the case of a sudden death, or a suicide. It reinforces the sense that the bereaved are powerless in any way to help their loved one who is gone. It is very important for survivors of sudden death to go and see the body, otherwise it can be difficult to realize that death has actually happened. If possible, people should sit quietly by the body, to say what they need to, express their love, and start to say goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If this is not possible, bring out a photo of the person who has just died and begin the process of saying goodbye, completing the relationship, and letting go. Encourage those who have suffered the sudden death of a loved one to do this, and it will help them to accept the new, searing reality of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tell them too of these ways I've been describing of helping a dead person, simple ways they too can use, instead of sitting hopelessly going over again and again the moment of death in silent frustration and self-recrimination. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the case of a sudden death, the survivors may often experience wild and unfamiliar feelings of <i class="calibre3"> anger</i> at what they see as the cause of the death. Help them express that anger, because if it is held inside, sooner or later it will plunge them into a chronic depression. Help them to let go of the anger and uncover the depths of pain that hide behind it. Then they can begin the painful but ultimately healing task of letting go. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It happens often too that someone is left after the death of a loved one feeling intense <i class="calibre3"> guilt, </i> obsessively reviewing mistakes in the past relationship, or torturing themselves about what they might have done to prevent the death. Help them to talk about their feelings of guilt, however irrational and crazy they may seem. Slowly these feelings will diminish, and they will come to forgive themselves and go on with their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A HEART PRACTICE </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would now like to give you a practice that can truly help you when you are suffering from deep sorrow and grief. It is a practice my master Jamyang Khyentse always used to give to people who were going through emotional torment or mental anguish and breakdown, and I know from my own experience it can bring enormous relief and solace. The life of someone teaching in a world like ours is not an easy one. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was younger there were many moments of crisis and difficulty, and then I would always invoke Padmasambhava, as I still always do, thinking of him as the same as all my masters. And so I discovered for myself how transforming this practice is, and why all my masters used to say that the practice of Padmasambhava is the most useful when you go through turmoil, because it has the power you need to take on and survive the chaotic confusion of this age. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So whenever you are desperate, anguished, or depressed, whenever you feel you cannot go on, or you feel your heart is breaking, I advise you to do this practice. The only conditions to the effectiveness of this practice are that you need to do it with all your might, and that you need to ask, really to ask, for help. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if you practice meditation, you will have emotional pain and suffering, and a lot of things from your past lives or this one may emerge that will be difficult to face. You may find you do not have the wisdom or the stability in your meditation to deal with them, and that your meditation on its own is not enough. What you need then is what I call "a heart practice." I always feel sad that people don't have a practice like this to help them in times of desperation, because if you do, you will find you have something immeasurably precious, which will also become a source of transformation and continuing strength. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">1. Invocation </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Invoke in the sky in front of you the presence of whichever enlightened being inspires you the most, and consider that this being is the embodiment of all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and masters. For me, as I have said, this embodiment is Padmasambhava. Even if you cannot imagine in your mind's eye any one form, just feel the presence strongly and invoke his or her infinite power, compassion, and blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Calling Out </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Open your heart and invoke him or her with all the pain and suffering you feel. If you feel like crying, don't hold back: let your tears flow, and really ask for help. Know that there <i class="calibre3"> is</i> someone who is absolutely there for you, someone who listens to you, who understands you with love and compassion, without ever judging you: an ultimate friend. Call to him or her from the depths of your pain, using the mantra OM AH </p>
<p class="calibre2">HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM, the mantra that has been used for centuries by hundreds of thousands of beings as a healing spring of purification and protection. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">3. Filling the Heart with Bliss </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine and know now that the buddha you are crying out to responds, with all his or her love, compassion, wisdom, and power. Tremendous rays of light stream out toward you from him or her. Imagine that light as nectar, filling your heart up completely, and transforming all your suffering into bliss. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One way in which Padmasambhava appears is simply sitting in meditation posture, wrapped in his gown and robes, exuding an enchanting feeling of warm and cozy comfort, and with a loving smile on his face. In this emanation he is called "Great Bliss." His hands lie relaxed in his lap, cradling a cup made from the top of a skull. It is full of the nectar of Great Bliss, swirling and sparkling, the source of all healing. He sits serenely on a lotus blossom, ringed by a shimmering sphere of light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Think of him as infinitely warm and loving, a sun of bliss, comfort, peace, and healing. Open your heart, let out all your suffering; cry out for help. And say his mantra: OM AH HUM </p>
<p class="calibre2">VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine now thousands of rays of light streaming out of his body or from his heart: Imagine that the nectar of Great Bliss in the skull cup in his hands overflows with joy and pours down over you in a continuous stream of soothing, golden liquid light. It flows into your heart, filling it and transforming your suffering into bliss. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This nectar flow from the Padmasambhava of Great Bliss is the wonderful practice that my master used to teach: it has never failed to give me great inspiration and help in times of real need. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">4. Helping Those Who Have Died </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">As you do this practice again and again, saying the mantra and filling your heart with bliss, slowly your suffering will dissolve in the confident peace of the nature of your mind. You will realize, with joy and delight, that the buddhas are not outside of you but always with you, inseparable from the nature of your mind. And what they have done through their blessing is to empower and nourish you with the confidence of the buddha within you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, with all the power and confidence this practice has given you, imagine you are sending this blessing, the light of healing compassion of the enlightened beings, to your loved one who has died. This is especially vital in the case of someone who has suffered a traumatic death, as it transforms their suffering and brings them peace and bliss. In the past, you may have felt helpless in your grief and impotent to help your dear friend, but now through this practice you can feel consoled, encouraged, and empowered to help the dead person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">KEEPING THE HEART OPEN </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't expect immediate results, or a miracle. It may only be after a while, or even much later, when you least expect it, that your suffering will shift. Do not have any expectation that it is going to "work," and end your grief once and for all. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Be open to your grief, as open as you are to the enlightened beings and buddhas in the practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">320 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">You may even come to feel mysteriously grateful toward your suffering, because it gives you such an opportunity of working through it and transforming it. Without it you would never have been able to discover that hidden in the nature and depths of suffering is a treasure of bliss. The times when you are suffering can be those when you are most open, and where you are extremely vulnerable can be where your greatest strength really lies. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Say to yourself then: "I am not going to run away from this suffering. I want to use it in the best and richest way I can, so that I can become more compassionate and more helpful to others." Suffering, after all, can teach us about compassion. If you suffer you will know how it is when others suffer. And if you are in a position to help others, it is through your suffering that you will find the understanding and compassion to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So whatever you do, don't shut off your pain; accept your pain and remain vulnerable. However desperate you become, accept your pain as it is, because it is in fact trying to hand you a priceless gift: the chance of discovering, through spiritual practice, what lies behind sorrow. "Grief," Rumi wrote, "can be the garden of compassion." If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life's search for love and wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And don't we know, only too well, that protection from pain doesn't work, and that when we try to defend ourselves from suffering, we only suffer more and don't learn what we can from the experience? As Rilke wrote, the protected heart that is "never exposed to loss, innocent and secure, cannot know tenderness; only the won-back heart can ever be satisfied: free, through all it has given up, to rejoice in its mastery."8 </p>
<p class="calibre2">ENDING GRIEF AND LEARNING THROUGH GRIEF<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">When you are overwhelmed by your suffering, try to inspire yourself in one of those many ways I mentioned when I spoke of meditation practice in Chapter 5, "Bringing the Mind Home." One of the most powerful methods I have found to soothe and dissolve sorrow is to go into nature, and especially to stand and contemplate by a waterfall, and let your tears and grief pour out of you and purify you, like the water flowing down. Or you could read a moving text on impermanence or sorrow, and let its wisdom bring you solace. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To accept and end grief <i class="calibre3"> is</i> possible. One way that many people have used and found helpful is a variation on the method I explained for completing unfinished business. No matter how long ago your loved one died, you will find this most effective. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Visualize that all the buddhas and enlightened beings are in the sky above and around you, shining down their rays of compassionate light and giving you their support and blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In their presence grieve and say what you have to say, what is really in your heart and mind, to your loved one who has died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Visualize that the person who is dead is looking at you with a greater love and understanding than he or she ever had while alive. Know that the dead person wants you to understand that he or she loves you and forgives you for whatever you may have done, and wants to ask for and receive <i class="calibre3"> your</i> forgiveness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Allow your heart to open and put into words any anger, any feelings of hurt, you may have been harboring, and let go of them completely. With your whole heart and mind, let your forgiveness go out toward the dead person. Tell him or her of your forgiveness; tell him or her of the regrets you feel for all the pain you may have caused. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now feel with your whole being his or her forgiveness and love streaming toward you. Know in the depths of yourself that you are lovable and deserve to be forgiven, and feel your grief dissolve. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the end of the practice, ask yourself if you can now truly say farewell and really let go of the person. Imagine the person turning and leaving, and then conclude by doing the phowa, or another practice for helping the dead. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This practice will give you the chance of showing your love once more, doing something to help the person who has died, and completing and healing the relationship in your heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You can learn so much, if you let yourself, from the grief and loss of bereavement. Bereavement can force you to look at your life direcdy, compelling you to find a purpose in it where there may not have been one before. When suddenly you find yourself alone after the death of someone you love, it can feel as if you are being given a new life and are being asked </p>
<p class="calibre2">"What will you do with this life? And why do you wish to continue living?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Loss and bereavement can also remind you sharply what can happen when in life you do not show your love and 3 2 2 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">appreciation, or ask for forgiveness, and so can make you far more sensitive to your loved ones who are alive. Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross said, "What I try to teach people is to live in such a way that you say those things while the other person can still hear it."9 And Raymond Moody, after his life's work in near-death research, wrote: "I have begun to realize how near to death we all are in our daily lives. More than ever now I am very careful to let each person I love know how I feel."10 </p>
<p class="calibre2">So my heartfelt advice to those in the depths of grief and despair after losing someone they dearly loved is to pray for help and strength and grace. Pray you will survive and discover the richest possible meaning to the new life you now find yourself in. Be vulnerable and receptive, be courageous, and be patient. Above all, look into your life to find ways of sharing your love more deeply with others now. </p>
<p id="p320" class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">TWENTY </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Near-Deathexperience: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">A Staircase to Heaven? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">WE HAVE BECOME very familiar now in the West </p>
<p class="calibre2">with the near-deathexperience, the name given to the range of experiences reported by people who have survived an incident of near or clinical death. The near-deathexperience has been reported throughout history, in all mystical and shamanic traditions, and by writers and philosophers as varied as Plato, Pope Gregory the Great, some of the great Sufi masters, Tolstoy, and Jung. My favorite example from history is the story told by a great English historian, the monk Bede, in the eighth century: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">About this time, a noteworthy miracle, like those of olden days,</i> <i class="calibre3">occurred in Britain. For, in order to arouse the living from spiritual</i> <i class="calibre3">death, a man already dead returned to bodily life and related</i> <i class="calibre3">many notable things that he had seen, some of which I have</i> <i class="calibre3">thought it valuable to mention here in brief. There was a head of a</i> <i class="calibre3">family living in a place in the country of the Northumbrians known</i> <i class="calibre3">as Cunningham, who led a devout life with all his household. He</i> <i class="calibre3">fell ill and grew steadily worse until the crisis came, and in the</i> <i class="calibre3">early hours of one night he died. But at daybreak he returned to</i> <i class="calibre3">life and suddenly sat up to the great consternation of those weeping</i> <i class="calibre3">around the body, who ran away; only his wife, who loved him</i> <i class="calibre3">more dearly, remained with him, though trembling and fearful. The</i> <i class="calibre3">man reassured her and said: "Do not be frightened; for I have</i> <i class="calibre3">truly risen from the grasp of death, and I am allowed to live</i> <i class="calibre3">among men agfdn. But henceforth I must not live as I used to, and</i> <i class="calibre3">must adopt a very different way of life". Not long afterward, he</i> <i class="calibre3">abandoned all worldly responsibilities and entered the monastery of</i> <i class="calibre3">Melrose. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bede goes on: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">This was the account he used to give of his experience: "A hand-some man in a shining robe was my guide, and we walked in</i> <i class="calibre3">silence in what appeared to be a northeasterly direction. As we traveled onward, we came to a very broad and deep valley of infinite</i> <i class="calibre3">length. He soon brought me out of darkness into an atmosphere</i> <i class="calibre3">of clear light, and as he led me forward in bright light, I saw before</i> <i class="calibre3">us a tremendous wall which seemed to be of infinite length and</i> <i class="calibre3">height in all directions. As I could see no gfite, window, or entrance</i> <i class="calibre3">in it, I begfm to wonder why we went up to the wall. But when we</i> <i class="calibre3">reached it, all at once</i>— <i class="calibre3">I know not by what means</i>— <i class="calibre3">we were on</i> <i class="calibre3">top of it Within lay a very broad and pleasant meadow... Such</i> <i class="calibre3">was the light flooding all this place that it seemed greater than the</i> <i class="calibre3">brightness of daylight or of the sun's rays at noon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">"(The guide said) 'You must now return to your body and live</i> <i class="calibre3">among men once more; but, if you will weigh your actions with</i> <i class="calibre3">greater care and study to keep your words and ways virtuous and</i> <i class="calibre3">simple, then when you die, you too will win a home among these</i> <i class="calibre3">happy spirits that you see. For, when I left you for a while, I did</i> <i class="calibre3">so in order to discover what your future would be.' When he told</i> <i class="calibre3">me this I was most reluctant to return to my body; for I was</i> <i class="calibre3">entranced by the pleasantness and beauty of the place I could see</i> <i class="calibre3">and the company I saw there. But I did not dare to question my</i> <i class="calibre3">guide, and meanwhile, I know not how, I suddenly found myself</i> <i class="calibre3">alive among men once more." </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bede ends his account with these words: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">This man of God would not discuss these and other things he had</i> <i class="calibre3">seen with any apathetic or careless-living people, but only with</i> <i class="calibre3">those who were ... willing to take his words to heart and grow in</i> <i class="calibre3">holiness.1 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The skill of modern medical technology has added a new and exciting dimension to the extent of the near-deathexperience; many people have now been revived from "death," for example, after accidents, heart attack, or serious illness, or in operations or combat. The near-deathexperience has been the subject of a great deal of scientific research and philosophical speculation. According to an authoritative 1982 Gallup poll, an extraordinary number of Americans—up to 8 million, or one in twenty in the population—have had at least one near-deathexperience.2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Although no two people have exactly the same experience, just as no two people could have identical experiences of the bardos, a common pattern of different phases in the near-deathexperience, a "core experience," appears: 1. They experience an altered state of feeling, of peace and well-being, without pain, bodily sensations, or fear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">2. They may be aware of a buzzing or rushing sound, and find themselves separated from their body. This is the so-called "out-of-the-body experience": They can view the body, often from a point somewhere above it; their sense of sight and hearing is heightened; their consciousness is clear and vividly alert, and they can even move through walls. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. They are aware of another reality, of entering a darkness, floating in a dimensionless space, and then moving rapidly through a tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4. They see a light, at first a point in the distance, and are magnetically drawn toward it and then enveloped in light and love. This light is described as a blinding light of great beauty, but the eyes are unhurt by it. Some people report meeting "a being of light," a luminous, seemingly omniscient presence that a few call God or Christ, who is compassionate and loving. Sometimes in this presence they may witness a fife-review, seeing everything they have done in their life, good and bad. They communicate telepathically with the presence, and find themselves in a timeless and usually blissful dimension in which all ordinary concepts like time and space are meaningless. Even if the experience lasts only one or two minutes in normal time, it can be of a vast elaboration and richness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">5. Some see an inner world of preternatural beauty, paradisal landscapes and buildings, with heavenly music, and they have a feeling of oneness. A very few, it seems, report terrifying visions of hellish realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">6. They may reach a boundary beyond which they cannot go; some meet dead relatives and friends and talk to them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They decide (often reluctantly) or are told to return to the body and this life, sometimes with a sense of mission and service, sometimes to protect and care for their family, sometimes simply to fulfill the purpose of their life, which has not been accomplished. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important aspect of the near-deathexperience, as reported again and again in the literature about it, is the complete transformation it often makes in the lives, attitudes, careers, and relationships of the people who have this experience. They may not lose their fear of pain and dying, but they lose their fear of death itself; they become more tolerant and loving; and they become interested in spiritual values, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"path of wisdom," and usually in a universal spirituality rather than the dogma of any one religion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How, then, should the near-deathexperience be interpreted? Some Western writers who have read the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan</i> <i class="calibre3">Book of the Dead</i> equate these experiences with the experiences of the bardos taught in the Tibetan tradition. At first glance there do seem to be tantalizing parallels between the two, but how exactly do the details of the near-deathexperience relate to the teachings on the bardos? I feel that this would require a special study beyond the scope of this book, but there are a number of similarities and differences we can see. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE<b class="calibre4"> </b>DARKNESS AND THE TUNNEL<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The final phase of the dissolution process of the bardo of dying, you will remember, is when the black experience of </p>
<p class="calibre2">"full attainment" dawns "like an empty sky shrouded in utter darkness." At this point, the teachings speak of a moment of bliss and joy. One of the main features of the near-deathexperience is the impression of moving "at a terrific speed" and </p>
<p class="calibre2">"feeling weightless" through a black space, "a total, peaceful, wonderful blackness," and down a "long, dark, tunnel." </p>
<p class="calibre2">One woman told Kenneth Ring: "It's just like a void, a nothing and it's such a peaceful—it's so pleasant that you can keep going. It's a complete blackness, there is no sensation at all, there was no feeling  . . . sort of like a dark tunnel. Just a floating. It's like being in mid-air."3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">And another woman told him: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The first thing I remember was a tremendous rushing sound, a</i> <i class="calibre3">tremendous. It's hard to find the right words to describe. The closest thing that I could possibly associate it with is, possibly, the sound</i> <i class="calibre3">of a tornado</i>— <i class="calibre3">a tremendous gushing wind, but almost pulling me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And I was being pulled into a narrow point from a wide area. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman told Margot Grey: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I was in what felt like outer space. It was absolutely black out there</i> <i class="calibre3">and I felt like I was being drawn towards an opening like at the</i> 
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">end of a tunnel. I knew this because I could see a light at the end;</i> <i class="calibre3">that's how I knew it was there. I was vertical and I was being</i> <i class="calibre3">drawn towards the opening. I know it wasn't a dream, dreams don't</i> <i class="calibre3">happen that way. I never once imagined it was a dream.5 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">T H E LIGHT<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the moment of death, the Ground Luminosity or Clear Light dawns in all its splendor. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says: "O son/daughter of an enlightened family  . . . your Rigpa is inseparable luminosity and emptiness and dwells as a great expanse of light; beyond birth or death, it is, in fact, the Buddha of Unchanging Light." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Melvin Morse, who has specialized in the research of near-deathexperiences in children, remarks: "Nearly every near-deathexperience of children (and about one-fourth of those of adults) has in it an element of light. They all report that the light appears at the final stages of the near-deathexperience, after they have had an out-of-body experience or have trav-elled up the tunnel."6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the best descriptions of the approach to the light was reported by Margot Grey: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Then gradually you realize that way, far off in the distance, an</i> <i class="calibre3">unmeasurable distance, you may be reaching the end of the tunnel,</i> <i class="calibre3">as you can see a white light, but it's so far away I can only compare it to looking up into the sky and in the distance seeing a</i> <i class="calibre3">single star, but visually you must remember that you are looking</i> <i class="calibre3">through a tunnel, and this light would fill the end of the tunnel. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">You concentrate on this speck of light because as you are propelled</i> <i class="calibre3">forward you anticipate reaching this light</i> <i class="calibre3">Gradually, as you travel towards it at an extreme speed it gets</i> <i class="calibre3">larger and larger. The whole process on reflection only seems to take</i> <i class="calibre3">about one minute. As you gradually draw nearer to this extremely</i> <i class="calibre3">brilliant light there is no sensation of an abrupt end of the tunnel, but</i> <i class="calibre3">rather more of a merging into the light. By now, the tunnel is behind</i> <i class="calibre3">you and before you is this magnificent, beautiful blue-white light. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The brilliance is so bright, brighter than a light that would immediately blind you, but absolutely does not hurt your eyes at all.7 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Many near-deathexperiencers describe the light itself: <i class="calibre3">My description of the light was</i>— <i class="calibre3">well, it was not a light, but the</i> <i class="calibre3">absence of darkness, total and complete. Well, you think of light as a big light shining on things making shadows and so forth. This</i> <i class="calibre3">light was really the absence of darkness. We're not used to that concept because we always get a shadow from the light unless the light</i> <i class="calibre3">is all around us. But this light was so total and complete that you</i> <i class="calibre3">didn't look at the light, you were in the light8 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">One person told Kenneth Ring, "It was not bright. It was like a shaded lamp or something. But it wasn't that kind of light that you get from a lamp. You know what it was? Like someone had put a shade over the sun. It made me feel very, very peaceful. I was no longer afraid. Everything was going to be all right."9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman told Margot Grey: "The light is brighter than anything you could possibly imagine. There are no words to describe it. I was so happy, it's impossible to explain. It was such a feeling of serenity, it was a marvelous feeling. The light is so bright that it would normally blind you, but it doesn't hurt one's eyes a bit." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Others recount how they not only see the light, but enter directly into the light, and they speak of the feelings they have: "I had no sense of separate identity. I was the light and one with it."10 </p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman who had undergone two major operations in two days told Margot Grey: "Only my essence was felt. Time no longer mattered and space was filled with bliss. I was bathed in radiant light and immersed in the aura of the rainbow. All was fusion. Sounds were of a new order, harmonious, nameless (now I call it music)."11 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another man who reached this point of entering the light describes it in this way: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The following series of events appear to happen simultaneously,</i> <i class="calibre3">but in describing them I will have to take them one at a time. The</i> <i class="calibre3">sensation is of a being of some kind, more a kind of energy, not a</i> <i class="calibre3">character in the sense of another person, but an intelligence with</i> <i class="calibre3">whom it is possible to communicate. Also, in size it just covers the</i> <i class="calibre3">entire vista before you. It totally engulfs everything, you feel</i> <i class="calibre3">enveloped. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The light immediately communicates to you, in an instant</i> <i class="calibre3">telekinesis your thought waves are read, regardless of language. A</i> <i class="calibre3">doubtful statement would be impossible to receive. The first message I received was "Relax, everything is beautiful, everything is</i> <i class="calibre3">okay, you have nothing to fear." I was immediately put at absolute</i> <i class="calibre3">ease. In the past if someone like a doctor had said "Its okay, you</i>   have nothing to fear, this won't hurt it usually did</i>— <i class="calibre3">you couldn't</i> <i class="calibre3">trust them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">But this was the most beautiful feeling I have ever known, it's</i> <i class="calibre3">absolute pure love. Every feeling, every emotion is just perfect. You</i> <i class="calibre3">feel warm, but it has nothing to do with temperature. Everything</i> <i class="calibre3">there is absolutely vivid and clear. What the light communicates to</i> <i class="calibre3">you is a feeling of true, pure love. You experience this for the first</i> <i class="calibre3">time ever. You can't compare it to the love of your wife, or the love</i> <i class="calibre3">of your children or sexual love. Even if all those things were combined, you cannot compare it to the feeling you get from this light12 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">A man who had almost drowned at the age of fourteen recalled: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">As I reached the source of the Light, I could see in. I cannot begin</i> <i class="calibre3">to describe in human terms the feelings I had over what I saw. It</i> <i class="calibre3">was a giant infinite world of calm, and love, and energy, and</i> <i class="calibre3">beauty. It was as though human life was unimportant compared to</i> <i class="calibre3">this. And yet it urged the importance of life at the same time as it</i> <i class="calibre3">solicited death as a means to a different and better life. It was all</i> <i class="calibre3">being, all beauty, all meaning for all existence. It was all the</i> <i class="calibre3">energy of the universe forever in one place.13 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Melvin Morse has written movingly of the near-deathexperiences of children, and tells how they describe the light in their simple eloquence: "I have a wonderful secret to tell you. I have been climbing a staircase to heaven." "I just wanted to get to that Light. Forget my body, forget everything. I just wanted to get to that Light." "There was a beautiful Light that had everything good in it. For about a week, I could see sparks of that Light in everything." "When I came out of the coma in the hospital, I opened my eyes and saw pieces of the Light everywhere. I could see how everything in the world fits together."14 </p>
<p class="calibre2">SIMILARITIES WITH THE BARDO OF BECOMING<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the near-deathexperience, the mind is momentarily released from the body, and goes through a number of experiences akin to those of the mental body in the bardo of becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1.  <i class="calibre3"> Out-of-Body Experience </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The near-deathexperience very often begins with an out-of-body experience: people can see their own body, as well as  the environment around them. This coincides with what has already been said about the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">"I remember coming round from the anesthetic and then drifting off and finding myself out of my body, over the bed looking down at my carcass. I was aware only of being a brain and eyes, I do not remember having a body."15 </p>
<p class="calibre2">A man who had suffered a heart attack told Kenneth Ring: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"It seemed like I was up there in space and just my mind was active. No body feeling, just like my brain was up in space. I had nothing but my mind. Weightless, I had nothing."16 </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Helplessly Watching Relatives </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have described how, in the bardo of becoming, the dead are able to see and hear their living relatives, but are unable, sometimes frustratingly, to communicate with them. A woman from Florida told Michael Sabom how she looked down on her mother from a point near the ceiling: "The biggest thing I remember was that I felt so sad that I couldn't somehow let her know that I was all right. Somehow I knew that I was all right, but I didn't know how to tell her .. ."17 </p>
<p class="calibre2">"I remember seeing them down the  h a l l . . . my wife, my oldest son and my oldest daughter and the doctor  . . . I didn't know why they were crying."18 </p>
<p class="calibre2">And a woman told Michael Sabom: "I was sitting way up there looking at myself convulsing and my mother and my maid screaming and yelling because they thought I was dead. I felt so sorry for  t h e m , . . . just deep, deep sadness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But I felt I was free up there and there was no reason for suffering."19 </p>
<p class="calibre2">3.  <i class="calibre3"> Perfect Form, Mobility, and Clairvoyance</i> The mental body in the bardo of becoming is described in the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> as being "like a body of the golden age," and as having almost supernatural mobility and clairvoyance. The near-deathexperiences also find that the form they have is complete and in the prime of life: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"I was floating and I was a much younger man. The impression I got was that I was able to see myself some way through a reflection or something where I was twenty years younger than what I actually was."20 </p>
<p class="calibre2">They find also that they can travel instantaneously, simply by the power of thought. A Vietnam veteran told Michael Sabom: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"I felt like I could have thought myself anywhere I wanted  
<p class="calibre2">to be instantly. I just felt exhilarated with a sense of power. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I could do what I wanted to. It's realer than here, really.21 </p>
<p class="calibre2">"I remember all of a sudden going right back to the battlefield where I had been  l o s t . It was almost like you materialize there and all of a sudden the next instant you were over here. It was just like you blinked your eyes."22 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Many near-deathexperiencers also report a clairvoyant sense of total knowledge "from the beginning of time to the end of time."23 A woman told Raymond Moody: "All of a sudden, all knowledge of all that had started from the very beginning, that would go on without end—for a second I knew all the secrets of the ages, all the meaning of the universe, the stars, the moon—of everything."24 </p>
<p class="calibre2">'There was a moment in this thing—well, there isn't any way to describe it—but it was like I knew all things. For a moment, there, it was like communication wasn't necessary. I thought whatever I wanted to know could be known."25 </p>
<p class="calibre2">"While I was there I felt at the center of things. I felt enlightened and cleansed. I felt I could see the point of everything. Everything fitted in, it all made sense, even the dark times. It almost seemed, too, as if the pieces of jigsaw all fitted together."26 </p>
<p class="calibre2">4.  <i class="calibre3"> Meeting Others </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Tibetan teachings the mental body in the bardo of becoming is described as meeting other beings in the bardo. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly the near-deathexperiencer is often able to converse with others who have died. Michael Sabom's Vietnam veteran said that as he lay unconscious on the battlefield, viewing his own body: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The thirteen guys that had been killed the day before that I had</i> <i class="calibre3">put in plastic bags were right there with me. And more than that,</i> <i class="calibre3">during the course of that month of May, my particular company</i> <i class="calibre3">lost forty-two dead. All forty-two of those guys were there. They</i> <i class="calibre3">were not in the form we perceive the human body</i>  . . .  <i class="calibre3"> but I know</i> <i class="calibre3">they were there. I felt their presence. We communicated without</i> <i class="calibre3">talking with our voices.27 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman whose heart stopped under anesthetic during a dental extraction said: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Then I found myself I was in a beautiful landscape, the grass is</i> <i class="calibre3">greener than anything seen on earth, it has a special light or glow. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The colors are beyond description, the colors here are so drab by</i> <i class="calibre3">comparison. In this place I saw people that I knew had died. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There were no words spoken, but it was as if I knew what they</i> <i class="calibre3">were thinking, and at the same time I knew that they knew what</i> <i class="calibre3">I was thinking? 1 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">5 <i class="calibre3">. Different Realms </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the bardo of becoming, as well as many other kinds of visions, the mental body will see visions and signs of different realms. A small percentage of those who have survived a near-deathexperience report visions of inner worlds, of paradises, cities of light, with transcendental music. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One woman told Raymond Moody: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Off in the distance ... I could see a city. There were buildings</i>— </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">separate buildings. They were gleaming, bright. People were</i> <i class="calibre3">happy in there. There was sparkling water, fountains ... a city</i> <i class="calibre3">of light I guess would be the way to say it... It was wonderful. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There was beautiful music. Everything was just glowing, wonderful </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">. . .  <i class="calibre3"> But if I had entered into this, I think I would never have</i> <i class="calibre3">retimed... I was told that if I went there I couldn't go back ... </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">that the decision was mine.29 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another person told Margot Grey: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I seemed to find myself in what appeared to be some type of structure or building, but there were no walls that I can remember. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There was only this all-pervading beautiful golden light. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I noticed about me many people that seemed to be walking or</i> <i class="calibre3">milling about; they didn't even appear to walk, but seemed somehow to glide. I didn't feel apart from them at all; one of the feelings I remember most about them was the feeling of unity, of being</i> <i class="calibre3">totally a part of everything around me and about me.30 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">6. Hellish Visions </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not all descriptions in the near-deathexperience, however, are positive, as you would expect from what we have spoken of in the Tibetan teachings. Some people report terrifying experiences of fear, panic, loneliness, desolation, and gloom, vividly reminiscent of the descriptions of the bardo of becoming. One person reported by Margot Grey spoke of being sucked into "a vast black vortex like a whirlpool," and those who have negative experiences tend to feel, rather like those about to be reborn in lower realms in the bardo of becoming, that they are traveling downward instead of upward:  
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I was moving along as fart of a river of sound</i>— <i class="calibre3">a constant babble</i> <i class="calibre3">of human noise... I felt myself sinking into and becoming fart of</i> <i class="calibre3">the stream and slowly being submerged by it. A great fear possessed me as if I knew that once overcome by this ever growing</i> <i class="calibre3">mass of noise that I would be lost.31 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I was looking down into a large fit, which was fill of swirling</i> <i class="calibre3">gray mist and there were all these hands and arms reaching up</i> <i class="calibre3">and trying to grab hold of me and drag me in there. There was a</i> <i class="calibre3">terrible wailing noise, fill of desperation.32 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Other people have even experienced what can only be called hellish visions, of intense cold or unbearable heat, and heard the sounds of tormented wailing or a noise like that of wild beasts. A woman reported by Margot Grey said: <i class="calibre3">I found myself in a place surrounded by mist. I felt I was in hell. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There was a big pit with vapor coming out and there were arms</i> <i class="calibre3">and hands coming out trying to grab mine. I was terrified that</i> <i class="calibre3">these hands were going to claw hold of me and pull me into the</i> <i class="calibre3">pit with them... An enormous lion bounded towards me from the</i> <i class="calibre3">other side and I let out a scream. I was not afraid of the lion, but I</i> <i class="calibre3">felt somehow he would unsettle me and push me into that dreadful</i> <i class="calibre3">pit. It was very hot down there and the vapor or steam was</i> <i class="calibre3">very hot.33 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">A man who suffered a cardiac arrest reported: "I was going down, down deep into the earth. There was anger and I felt this horrible fear. Everything was gray. The noise was fear-some, with snarling and crashing like maddened wild animals, gnashing their teeth."34 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Raymond Moody writes that several people claimed to have seen beings who seemed trapped by their inability to surrender their attachments to the physical world: possessions, people, or habits. One woman spoke of these "bewildered people": </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">What you would think of as their head was bent downward; they</i> <i class="calibre3">had sad depressed looks; they seemed to shuffle, as someone</i> <i class="calibre3">would on a chain gfing ... they looked washed out, dull, gray. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And they seemed to be forever shuffling and moving around, not</i> <i class="calibre3">knowing where they were going, not knowing who to follow, or</i> <i class="calibre3">what to look for. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">As I went by they didn't even raise their heads to see what was</i> <i class="calibre3">happening. They seemed to be thinking, "Well, it's all over with. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">What am I doing? What's it all about?" just this absolute,</i> <i class="calibre3">crushed, hopeless demeanor</i>— <i class="calibre3">not knowing what to do or where to</i> <i class="calibre3">go or who they were or anything else. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">They seemed to be forever moving, rather than just sitting, but</i> <i class="calibre3">in no special direction. They would start straight, then veer to the</i> <i class="calibre3">left and take a few steps and veer back to the right And absolutely nothing to do. Searching, but for what they were searching I</i> <i class="calibre3">don't know.35 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the accounts we have of the near-deathexperience, a border or limit is occasionally perceived; a point of no return is reached. At this border the person then chooses (or is instructed) to return to life, sometimes by the presence of light. Of course in the Tibetan bardo teachings there is no parallel to this, because they describe what happens to a person who actually dies. However, in Tibet there was a group of people, called <i class="calibre3"> deloks, </i> who had something like a near-deathexperience, and what they report is fascinatingly similar. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE DELOK: A TIBETAN NEAR-DEAtheXPERIENCE </p>
<p class="calibre2">A curious phenomenon, little known in the West, but familiar to Tibetans, is the delok. In Tibetan <i class="calibre3"> de lok</i> means "returned from death," and traditionally deloks are people who seemingly "die" as a result of an illness, and find themselves traveling in the bardo. They visit the hell realms, where they witness the judgment of the dead and the sufferings of hell, and sometimes they go to paradises and buddha realms. They can be accompanied by a deity, who protects them and explains what is happening. After a week the delok is sent back to the body with a message from the Lord of Death for the living, urging them to spiritual practice and a beneficial way of life. Often the deloks have great difficulty making people believe their story, and they spend the rest of their lives recounting their experiences to others in order to draw them toward the path of wisdom. The biographies of some of the more famous deloks were written down, and are sung all over Tibet by traveling minstrels. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A number of aspects of the delok correspond not only with, as you would expect, the bardo teachings such as the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan</i> <i class="calibre3">Book of the Dead, </i> but also with the near-deathexperience. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Lingza Chokyi was a famous delok who came from my part of Tibet and lived in the sixteenth century. In her biography she tells how she failed to realize she was dead, how she  
<p class="calibre2">found herself out of her body, and saw a pig's corpse lying on her bed, wearing her clothes. Frantically she tried in vain to communicate with her family, as they set about the business of the practices for her death. She grew furious with them when they took no notice of her and did not give her her plate of food. When her children wept, she felt a "hail of pus and blood" fall, which caused her intense pain. She tells us she felt joy each time the practices were done, and immeasurable happiness when finally she came before the master who was practicing for her and who was resting in the nature of mind, and her mind and his became one. </p>
<p class="calibre2">After a while she heard someone whom she thought was her father calling to her, and she followed him. She arrived in the bardo realm, which appeared to her like a country. From there, she tells us, there was a bridge that led to the hell realms, and to where the Lord of Death was counting the good or evil actions of the dead. In this realm she met various people who recounted their stories, and she saw a great yogin who had come into the hell realms in order to liberate beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally Lingza Chokyi was sent back to the world, as there had been an error concerning her name and family, and it was not yet her time to die. With the message from the Lord of Death to the living, she returned to her body and recovered, and spent the rest of her life telling of what she had learned. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The phenomenon of the delok was not simply a historical one; it continued up until very recently in Tibet. Sometimes a delok would leave the body for about a week, and meet people who had died, sometimes quite unknown to the delok, who would give messages for their living relatives and ask these relatives to do certain kinds of practices on their behalf. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The delok would then return to his or her body and deliver their messages. In Tibet this was an accepted occurrence, and elaborate methods were devised for detecting whether deloks were fraudulent or not. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's daughter told Frangoise Pommaret, author of a book on the deloks, that in Tibet, while the delok was undergoing his or her experience, the orifices of the body were stopped with butter, and a paste made from barley flour put over the face.36 If the butter did not run and the mask did not crack, the delok was recognized as authentic. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The tradition of deloks continues in the Tibetan Himalayan regions today. These deloks are quite ordinary people, often women, who are very devoted and have great faith. They </p>
<p class="calibre2">"die" on special days in the Buddhist calendar, for a number of  hours, and their major function is to act as messengers between the living and the dead. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MESSAGE OF THE NEAR-DEAtheXPERIENCE<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">As we have seen, there are significant similarities between the near-deathexperience and the bardo teachings; there are also significant differences. The greatest difference, of course, is the fact that the near-deathexperiencers do <i class="calibre3"> not</i> die, whereas the teachings describe what happens to people as they die, after actual physical death, and as they take rebirth. The fact that the near-deathexperiencers do not go further on the journey into death—some of them are only "dead" for one minute—must go some way to explaining at least the possibility for disparities between the two accounts. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some writers have suggested the near-deathexperience expresses the stages of the dissolution process in the bardo of dying. It is premature, I feel, to try to link the near-deathexperience too precisely with the bardo descriptions, because the person who has survived the near-deathexperience has only been—literally—"near death." I explained to my master Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche the nature of the near-deathexperience, and he called it a phenomenon that belongs to the natural bardo of <i class="calibre3"> this</i> life, because the consciousness merely leaves the body of the person who has "died," and wanders temporarily in various realms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche implied that the near-deathexperiencers are experiencing their clinical death within the natural bardo of this life. Perhaps they are standing on the threshold of the bardos, but they have not actually entered into them and returned. Whatever they experience, they are still in the natural bardo of this life. Is their experience of the light similar to the dawning of the Ground Luminosity? Could it be that just before its vast sun rises, they catch a strong glimpse of the first rays of dawn? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever the ultimate meaning of the details of the near-deathexperience, I remain extremely moved by the many accounts I have heard or read, and struck especially by some of the attitudes that flow from these experiences, attitudes that mirror so richly the Buddhist view of life. Two I have already spoken of: the profound transformation and spiritual awakening that takes place in those who have been through this experience; and the implications for our lives of the life review. The life-review happens again and again in the near-deathexperience, and demonstrates so clearly the inescapabil-ity of karma and the far-reaching and powerful effects of all our actions, words, and thoughts. The central message that the near-deathexperiencers bring back from their encounter with death, or the presence or "being of light," is exactly the same as that of Buddha and of the bardo teachings: that the essential and most important qualities in life are love and knowledge, compassion and wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They are surely beginning to see what the bardo teachings tell us: that life and death are in the mind itself. And the confidence that many of them seem to have after this experience reflects this deeper understanding of mind. </p>
