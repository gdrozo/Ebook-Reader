<p class="calibre2">Everything tha t we see around us is seen as it is because we hav e been repeatedly solidifying our  experience of inner an d oute r  reality in th e sam e way, lifetim e after  lifetime , an d thi s ha s led to th e mistaken assumption tha t wha t we see is objectively real. In fact, as we go further along the spiritual path, we learn  ho w to wor k directly with our  fixed perceptions. All our  old concepts of th e worl d or  matter  or  even ourselves ar e purified an d dissolved , an d an entirely new, wha t you could call "heavenly "  field of vision and perception opens up . As Blake says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">If  the doors of perception were cleansed,</i> <i class="calibre3">Everything would appear as it is, infinite.3 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I shal l never  forget whe n Dudjo m Rinpoche, in a moment of intimacy, leane d toward me and said in his soft, hoarse, slightl y high-pitched voice: "You know , don't you, that actually all these things around us go away , just go awa y ..." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wit h most of us, however, karma an d negative emotions obscure the ability to see our own intrinsic nature, and the nature of reality. As a result we clutch ont o happiness an d suffering as real, and in our unskillful and ignorant actions go on sowing the seeds of our next birth. Our actions keep us bound to th e continuous cycle of worldl y existence, to th e endless round of birth and death. So everything is at risk in ho w we live now, at thi s ver y moment:  Ho w we live now can cost us our  entire future. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thi s is th e real an d urgent reason  wh y we mus t prepare no w to meet death wisely, to transform our  karmic future, an d to avoid th e tragedy of falling int o delusio n again an d again an d repeating th e painful round of birth an d death.

As Padmasambhava says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now when  the bardo of this life is dawning upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will abandon laziness for which life has no time,</i> 120 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Enter, undistracted, the path of listening and hearing, reflection and</i> <i class="calibre3">contemplation, and meditation, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Making perceptions and mind the path, and realize the "three</i> kayas7: <i class="calibre3"> the enlightened mind;4 </i></p>

<p class="calibre2">THE WISDOM THAT REALIZES EGOLESSNESS<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">I sometimes wonder what a person from a little village in Tibet would feel if you suddenly brought him to a modern city with all its sophisticated technology. He would probably think he had already died and was in the bardo state. He would gape incredulously at the planes flying in the sky above him, or at someone talking on the telephone to another person on the other side of the world. He would assume he was witnessing miracles. And yet all this seems normal to someone living in the modern world with a Western education, which explains the scientific background to these things, step by step. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In just the same way, in Tibetan Buddhism there is a basic, normal, elementary spiritual education, a complete spiritual training for the natural bardo of this life, which gives you the essential vocabulary, the ABC of the mind. The bases of this training are what are called the "three wisdom tools": the wisdom of listening and hearing; the wisdom of contemplation and reflection; and the wisdom of meditation. Through them we are brought to reawaken to our true nature, through them we uncover and come to embody the joy and freedom of what we truly are, what we call "the wisdom that realizes egolessness." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine a person who suddenly wakes up in hospital after a road accident to find she is suffering from total amnesia. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Outwardly, everything is intact: she has the same face and form, her senses and her mind are there, but she doesn't have any idea or any trace of memory of who she really is. In exactly the same way, we cannot remember our true identity, our original nature. Frantically, and in real dread, we cast around and improvise another identity, one we clutch onto with all the desperation of someone falling continuously into an abyss. This false and ignorantly assumed identity is "ego." </p>
<p class="calibre2">So ego, then, is the absence of true knowledge of who we really are, together with its result: a doomed clutching on, at all costs, to a cobbled together and makeshift image of ourselves, an inevitably chameleon charlatan self that keeps changing and has to, to keep alive the fiction of its existence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THIS LIFE: THE NATURAL BARDO  1 2 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibetan ego is called <i class="calibre3"> dak dzin, </i> which means "grasping to a self." Ego is then defined as incessant movements of grasping at a delusory notion of T' and "mine," self and other, and all the concepts, ideas, desires, and activity that will sustain that false construction. Such a grasping is futile from the start and condemned to frustration, for there is no basis or truth in it, and what we are grasping at is by its very nature ungraspable. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The fact that we need to grasp at all and go on and on grasping shows that in the depths of our being we know that the self does not inherently exist. From this secret, unnerving knowledge spring all our fundamental insecurities and fear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So long as we haven't unmasked the ego, it continues to hoodwink us, like a sleazy politician endlessly parading bogus promises, or a lawyer constantly inventing ingenious lies and defenses, or a talk show host talking on and on, keeping up a stream of suave and emptily convincing chatter, which actually says nothing at all. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Lifetimes of ignorance have brought us to identify the whole of our being with ego. Its greatest triumph is to inveigle us into believing its best interests are our best interests, and even into identifying our very survival with its own. This is a savage irony, considering that ego and its grasping are at the root of all our suffering. Yet ego is so convincing, and we have been its dupe for so long, that the thought that we might ever become egoless terrifies us. To be egoless, ego whispers to us, is to lose all the rich romance of being human, to be reduced to a colorless robot or a brain-dead vegetable. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ego plays brilliantly on our fundamental fear of losing control, and of the unknown. We might say to ourselves: "I should really let go of ego, I'm in such pain; but if I do, what's going to happen to me?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ego will chime in, sweetly: "I know I'm sometimes a nui-sance, and believe me, I quite understand if you want me to leave. But is that really what you want? Think: If I do go, what's going to happen to you? Who will look after you? Who will protect and care for you like I've done all these years?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">And even if we were to see through ego's lies, we are just too scared to abandon it, for without any true knowledge of the nature of our mind, or true identity, we simply have no other alternative. Again and again we cave in to its demands with the same sad self-hatred as the alcoholic feels reaching for the drink that he knows is destroying him, or the drug addict groping for the drug that she knows after a brief high will only leave her flat and desperate. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">122 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">EGO ON THE SPIRITUAL PATH<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">To end the bizarre tyranny of ego is why we go on the spiritual path, but the resourcefulness of ego is almost infinite and it can at every stage sabotage and pervert our desire to be free of it. The truth is simple, and the teachings are extremely clear; but I have seen again and again, with great sadness, that as soon as they begin to touch and move us, ego tries to complicate them because it knows it is fundamentally threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the beginning, when we first become fascinated by the spiritual path and all its possibilities, ego may even encourage us and say: "This is really wonderful. Just the thing for you! </p>
<p class="calibre2">This teaching makes total sense!" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then when we say we want to try meditation practice, or go on a retreat, ego will croon: "What a marvelous idea! Why don't I come with you? We can both learn something." All through the honeymoon period of our spiritual development, ego will keep urging us on: 'This is wonderful—it's so amazing, so inspiring." </p>
<p class="calibre2">But as soon as we enter what I call the "kitchen sink" </p>
<p class="calibre2">period of the spiritual path, and the teachings begin to touch us deeply, unavoidably we are faced with the truth of our selves. As the ego is revealed, its sore spots are touched, and all sorts of problems will start arising. It's as if a mirror we cannot look away from were stuck in front of us. The mirror is totally clear, but there is an ugly, glowering face in it, our own, staring back at us. We begin to rebel because we hate what we see; we may strike out in anger and smash the mirror, but it will only shatter into hundreds of identical ugly faces, all still staring at us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now is the time we begin to rage and complain bitterly; and where is our ego? Standing staunchly by our side, egging us on: "You're quite right, this is outrageous and unbearable. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't stand for it!" As we listen enthralled, ego goes on to conjure up all sorts of doubts and demented emotions, throw-ing fuel on the fire: "Can't you see now this is not the right teaching for you? I told you so all along! Can't you see he is not your teacher? After all, you are an intelligent, modern, sophisticated Western person, and exotic things like Zen, Sufism, meditation, Tibetan Buddhism belong to foreign, Eastern cultures. What possible use could a philosophy made up in the Himalayas a thousand years ago be to you?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">As ego watches us gleefully become more and more ensnared in its web, it will even blame all the pain, loneliness, THIS LIFE: THE NATURAL BARDO  1 2 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">and difficulties we are going through as we come to know ourselves on the teaching, and even on the teacher: "These gurus don't care anyway, whatever you're going through. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They are only out to exploit you. They just use words like </p>
<p class="calibre2">'compassion' and 'devotion' to get you in their power." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ego is so clever that it can twist the teachings for its own purposes; after all, 'The devil can quote scriptures for his own ends." Ego's ultimate weapon is to point its finger hypocriti-cally at the teacher and his followers and say: "No one around here seems to be living up to the truth of the teachings!" Now ego poses as the righteous arbiter of all conduct: the shrewdest position of all from which to undermine your faith, and erode whatever devotion and commitment to spiritual change you have. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet however hard ego may try to sabotage the spiritual path, if you really continue on it, and work deeply with the practice of meditation, you will begin slowly to realize just how gulled you have been by ego's promises: false hopes and false fears. Slowly you begin to understand that both hope and fear are enemies of your peace of mind; hopes deceive you, and leave you empty and disappointed, and fears paralyze you in the narrow cell of your false identity. You begin to see also just how all-encompassing the sway of ego has been over your mind, and in the space of freedom opened up by meditation, when you are momentarily released from grasping, you glimpse the exhilarating spaciousness of your true nature. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You realize that for years, your ego, like a crazy con artist, has been swindling you with schemes and plans and promises that have never been real and have only brought you to inner bankruptcy. When, in the equanimity of meditation, you see this, without any consolation or desire to cover up what you've discovered, all the plans and schemes reveal themselves as hollow and start to crumble. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not a purely destructive process. Alongside an extremely precise and sometimes painful realization of the fraudulence and virtual criminality of your ego, and everyone else's, grows a sense of inner expansiveness, a direct knowledge of the "egolessness" and interdependence of all things, and that vivid and generous humor that is the hallmark of freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Because you have learned through discipline to simplify your life, and so reduced the opportunities for ego to seduce you; and because you have practiced the mindfulness of meditation, and through it loosened the hold of aggression, clinging, 124 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">and negativity on your whole being, the wisdom of insight can slowly dawn. And in the all-revealing clarity of its sunlight this insight can show you, distinctly and directly, both the subtlest workings of your own mind and the nature of reality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE WISE GUIDE </p>
<p class="calibre2">Two people have been living in you all your life. One is the ego, garrulous, demanding, hysterical, calculating; the other is the hidden spiritual being, whose still voice of wisdom you have only rarely heard or attended to. As you listen more and more to the teachings, contemplate them, and integrate them into your life, your inner voice, your innate wisdom of discernment, what we call in Buddhism "discriminating awareness," is awakened and strengthened, and you begin to distinguish between its guidance and the various clamorous and enthralling voices of ego. The memory of your real nature, with all its splendor and confidence, begins to return to you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You will find, in fact, that you have uncovered in yourself your own wise guide. Because he or she knows you through and through, since he or she <i class="calibre3"> is</i> you, your guide can help you, with increasing clarity and humor, negotiate all the difficulties of your thoughts and emotions. Your guide can also be a continual, joyful, tender, sometimes teasing presence, who knows always what is best for you and will help you find more and more ways out of your obsession with your habitual responses and confused emotions. As the voice of your discriminating awareness grows stronger and clearer, you will start to distinguish between its truth and the various deceptions of the ego, and you will be able to listen to it with discernment and confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The more often you listen to this wise guide, the more easily you will be able to change your negative moods yourself, see through them, and even laugh at them for the absurd dramas and ridiculous illusions that they are. Gradually you will find yourself able to free yourself more and more quickly from the dark emotions that have ruled your life, and this ability to do so is the greatest miracle of all. Terton Sogyal, the Tibetan mystic, said that he was not really impressed by someone who could turn the floor into the ceiling or fire into water. A real miracle, he said, was if someone could liberate just one negative emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">More and more, then, instead of the harsh and fragmented THIS LIFE: THE NATURAL BARDO<b class="calibre4"> 125 </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">gossip that ego has been talking to you all your life, you will find yourself hearing in your mind the clear directions of the teachings, which inspire, admonish, guide, and direct you at every turn. The more you listen, the more guidance you will receive. If you follow the voice of your wise guide, the voice of your discriminating awareness, and let ego fall silent, you come to experience that presence of wisdom and joy and bliss that you really are. A new life, utterly different from that when you were masquerading as your ego, begins in you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And when death comes, you will have learned already in life how to control those emotions and thoughts that in the states of death, the bardos, would otherwise take on an overwhelming reality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When your amnesia over your identity begins to be cured, you will realize finally that dak dzin, grasping at self, is the root cause of all your suffering. You will understand at last how much harm it has done both to yourself and to others, and you will realize that both the noblest and the wisest thing to do is to cherish others instead of cherishing yourself. This will bring healing to your heart, healing to your mind, and healing to your spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is important to remember always that the principle of egolessness does not mean that there was an ego in the first place, and the Buddhists did away with it. On the contrary, it means there was never any ego at all to begin with. To realize that is called "egolessness." </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE THREE WISDOM TOOLS<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The way to discover the freedom of the wisdom of egolessness, the masters advise us, is through the process of listening and hearing, contemplation and reflection, and meditation. They advise us to begin by <i class="calibre3"> listening</i> repeatedly to the spiritual teachings. As we listen, they will keep on and on reminding us of our hidden wisdom nature. It is as if we were that person I asked you to imagine, lying in the hospital bed suffering from amnesia, and someone who loved and cared for us were whispering our real name in our ear, and showing us photos of our family and old friends, trying to bring back our knowledge of our lost identity. Gradually, as we listen to the teachings, certain passages and insights in them will strike a strange chord in us, memories of our true nature will start to trickle back, and a deep feeling of something homely and uncannily familiar will slowly awaken. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">126 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Listening is a far more difficult process than most people imagine; really to listen in the way that is meant by the masters is to let go utterly of ourselves, to let go of all the information, all the concepts, all the ideas, and all the prq'udices that our heads are stuffed with. If you really listen to the teachings, those concepts that are our real hindrance, the one thing that stands between us and our true nature, can slowly and steadily be washed away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In trying to really listen, I have often been inspired by the Zen master Suzuki-roshi, who said: "If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."5 The beginner's mind is an open mind, an empty mind, a ready mind, and if we really listen with a beginner's mind, we might really begin to hear. If we listen with a silent mind, as free as possible from the clamor of pre-conceived ideas, a possibility will be created for the truth of the teachings to pierce us, and for the meaning of life and death to become increasingly and startlingly clear. My master Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche said: "The more and more you listen, the more and more you hear; the more and more you hear, the deeper and deeper your understanding becomes." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The deepening of understanding, then, comes through <i class="calibre3"> contemplation</i> and reflection, the second tool of wisdom. As we contemplate what we've heard, it gradually begins to permeate our mindstream and saturate our inner experience of our lives. Everyday events start to mirror and more and more subtly and directly to confirm the truths of the teachings, as contemplation slowly unfolds and enriches what we have begun to understand intellectually and carries that understanding down from our head into our heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The third tool of wisdom is <i class="calibre3"> meditation. </i> After listening to the teachings and reflecting on them, we put into action the insights we have gained and apply them directly, through the process of meditation, to the needs of everyday life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">DOUBTS ON THE PATH </p>
<p class="calibre2">Once, it seems, there was a time when an exceptional master could give one teaching to an exceptional student, and the student could attain liberation. Dudjom Rinpoche used to tell the story of a powerful bandit in India, who after countless successful raids, realized the terrible suffering he had been causing. He yearned for some way of atoning for what he had THIS LIFE: THE NATURAL BARDO  1 2 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">done, and visited a famou s master . He aske d him : " I am a sinner , I am in torment. What' s th e wa y out ? Wha t can I do? " </p>
<p class="calibre2">Th e master looked th e bandit up and down and the n asked him wha t he was good at. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Nothing, "  replie d th e bandit . </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Nothing? "  barked th e master. "You mus t be good at something! "  Th e bandit  wa s silent for  a while, and eventually admitted: "Actually, there is one thing I have a talent for, and that's stealing. " </p>
<p class="calibre2">Th e maste r  chuckled : "Good! That's exactly the skill you'll need now. Go to a quie t plac e an d rob all your  perceptions, an d stea l all th e stars and planets in th e sky, an d dissolve the m int o th e belly of emptiness, th e all-encompassing space of th e nature of mind. "  Within twenty-one day s th e bandit ha d realized th e nature of his mind, an d eventually cam e to be regarded as one of the great saints of India. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In ancien t times , then , there wer e extraordinary masters an d students as receptive and single-minded as tha t bandit wh o could , by just practicing with unswerving devotio n one single instruction, attain liberation. Even now, if we wer e to pu t our  mind to one powerful wisdom method and work with it directly , ther e is a rea l possibility we would becom e enlightened. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our  minds , however , ar e riddled and confused with doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I sometimes think that doubt is an even greater  block to human evolutio n than desir e and attachment. Our  society promotes cleverness instead of wisdom, and celebrates the most superficial, harsh, an d least useful aspect s of our  intelligence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We hav e become so falsely "sophisticated "  an d neurotic tha t we take doubt itself for  truth, and th e doubt tha t is nothing more tha n ego' s desperate attempt to defend itself from wisdom is deified as th e goal and frui t of true knowledge. Thi s form of mean-spirited doubt is the shabby emperor of samsara, serve d by a flock of "experts"  wh o teac h us not th e open-souled an d generous doubt that Buddha assured us was necessary for  testing and proving th e worth of th e teachings, bu t a destructive form of doub t tha t leaves us nothing to believe in, nothing to hope for, an d nothing to live by. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our  contemporary education, then, indoctrinates us in th e glorification of doubt, ha s created in fact wha t could almos t be called a religio n or  theolog y of doubt, in which to be seen to be intelligent we hav e to be seen to doubt everything, to alway s poin t to what' s wrong an d rarely to ask what' s right or good, cynically to denigrate all inherited spiritual ideals and 128 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">philosophies, or anything that is done in simple goodwill or with an innocent heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Buddha summons us to another kind of doubt, "like analyzing gold, scorching, cutting, and rubbing it to test its purity." For that form of doubt that really would expose us to the truth if we followed it to the end, we have neither the insight, the courage, nor the training. We have been schooled in a sterile addiction to contradiction that has robbed us repeatedly of all real openness to any more expansive and ennobling truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the place of our contemporary nihilistic form of doubt, then, I would ask you to put what I call a "noble doubt," the kind of doubt that is an integral part of the path toward enlightenment. The vast truth of the mystical teachings handed down to us is not something that our endangered world can afford to dismiss. Instead of doubting <i class="calibre3"> them, </i> why don't we doubt ourselves: our ignorance, our assumption that we understand everything already, our grasping and evasion, our passion for so-called explanations of reality that have about them nothing of the awe-inspiring and all-encompassing wisdom of what the masters, the messengers of Reality, have told us? </p>
<p class="calibre2">This kind of noble doubt spurs us onward, inspires us, tests us, makes us more and more authentic, empowers us, and draws us more and more within the exalting energy field of the truth. When I am with my masters, I ask them again and again the questions I need answers to. Sometimes I don't get clear answers, but I do not doubt them or the truth of the teachings. Sometimes I may doubt my own spiritual maturity or my ability to really hear the truth in a way that I could fully understand, and more often I press on asking and asking, until I do get a clear answer. And when that answer comes, and rings strongly and purely in my mind, and my heart responds to it with a shock of gratitude and recognition, then a conviction is inspired in me that the derision of a world of doubters could not destroy. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember one winter, when I was driving with one of my students from Paris down to Italy on a clear and moonlit night. She worked as a therapist, and had undergone many different kinds of training. What she had realized, she told me, was that the more knowledge you have, the more doubts it gives rise to, and the subtler the excuses for doubting whenever the truth begins to touch you deeply. She had tried many times, she said, to run away from the teachings, but finally THIS LIFE: THE NATURAL BARDO  1 2 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">she realized that there was nowhere to run to, because what she was really trying to run away from was herself. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I told her that doubt is not a disease, but merely a symptom of a lack of what we in our tradition call "the View," </p>
<p class="calibre2">which is the realization of the nature of mind, and so of the nature of reality. When that View is there completely, there will be no possibility for the slightest trace of doubt, for then we'll be looking at reality with its own eyes. But until we reach enlightenment, I said, there will inevitably be doubts, because doubt is a fundamental activity of the unenlightened mind, and the only way to deal with doubts is neither to sup-press nor indulge them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Doubts demand from us a real skillfulness in dealing with them, and I notice how few people have any idea how to pursue doubts or to use them. Isn't it ironic that in a civilization that so worships the power of deflation and doubt, hardly anyone has the courage to deflate the claims of doubt itself, to do as one Hindu master said: turn the dogs of doubt on doubt itself, to unmask cynicism and to uncover the fear, despair, hopelessness, and tired conditioning it springs from? Then doubt would no longer be an obstacle, but a door to realization, and whenever doubt appeared in the mind, a seeker would welcome it as a means of going deeper into the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a story I love about a Zen master. This master had a faithful but very naive student, who regarded him as a living buddha. Then one day the master accidentally sat down on a needle. He screamed, "Ouch!" and jumped into the air. The student instantly lost all his faith and left, saying how disappointed he was to find that his master was not fully enlightened. Otherwise, he thought, how would he jump up and scream out loud like that? The master was sad when he realized his student had left, and said: "Alas, poor man! If only he had known that in reality neither I, nor the needle, nor the </p>
<p class="calibre2">'ouch' really existed." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't let us make the same impulsive mistake as that Zen student. Don't let us take doubts with exaggerated seriousness, or let them grow out of proportion, or become black-and-white or fanatical about them. What we need to learn is how slowly to change our culturally conditioned and passionate involvement with doubt into a free, humorous, and compassionate one. This means giving doubts time, and giving ourselves time to find answers to our questions that are not merely intellectual or "philosophical," but living and real and genuine and workable. Doubts cannot resolve themselves 130 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">immediately; but if we are patient a space can be created within us, in which doubt s can be carefully and objectivel y examined, unraveled, dissolved , an d healed. Wha t we lack, especially in this culture, is the right undistracted and richly spacious environment of th e mind , which can only be created through sustained meditation practice, an d in which insights can be given th e chance slowly to mature and ripen. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don' t be in too muc h of a hurry to solve all your  doubts and problems; as th e masters say, "Make haste slowly."  I always tell my students not to have unreasonable expectations, because it takes tim e for  spiritual growth. It takes year s to learn Japanese properly or become a doctor: Ca n we really expect to hav e all th e answers, let alon e become enlightened, in a few weeks? Th e spiritual journey is one of continuous learning an d purification. Whe n you kno w this , you becom e humble. There is a famous Tibetan saying : "D o not mistake understanding for  realization, and do not mistake realization for  liberation. "  And Milarep a said: "D o not entertain hope s for realization, bu t practice all your  life."  On e of th e thing s I hav e come to appreciate most abou t my own tradition is its down -</p>
<p class="calibre2">to-earth, no-nonsense practicality, and its acute sense tha t th e greatest achievements tak e th e deepes t patience an d th e longest time . </p>

<p class="calibre2">IN THE SUFI MASTER RUMl's <i class="calibre3"> Table Talk, </i> there is this fierce and pointed passage: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The master said there is one thing in this world which must never</i> <i class="calibre3">be forgotten. If you were to forget everything else, but were not to</i> <i class="calibre3">forget this, there would be no cause to worry, while if you remembered, performed and attended to everything else, but forgot that</i> <i class="calibre3">one thing, you would in fact have done nothing whatsoever. It is as</i> <i class="calibre3">if a king had sent you to a country to carry out one special, specific</i> <i class="calibre3">task. You go to the country and you perform a hundred other</i> <i class="calibre3">tasks, but if you have not performed the task you were sent for, it</i> <i class="calibre3">is as if you have performed nothing at all. So man has come into</i> <i class="calibre3">the world for a particular task, and that is his purpose. If he</i> <i class="calibre3">doesn't perform it, he will have done nothing. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the spiritual teachers of humanity have told us the same thing, that the purpose of life on earth is to achieve union with our fundamental, enlightened nature. The "task" for which the "king" has sent us into this strange, dark country is to realize and embody our true being. There is only one way to do this, and that is to undertake the spiritual journey, with all the ardor and intelligence, courage and resolve for transformation that we can muster. As Death says to Nachiketas in the Katha Upanishad: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There is the path of wisdom and the path of ignorance. They are</i> <i class="calibre3">far apart and lead to different ends. Abiding in the midst of</i> <i class="calibre3">ignorance, thinking themselves wise and learned, fools go aimlessly</i> <i class="calibre3">hither and thither like the blind led by the blind. What lies beyond</i> <i class="calibre3">life shines not to those who are childish, or careless, or deluded by</i> <i class="calibre3">wealth. </i></p>

<p class="calibre2">132 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">FINDING THE WAY<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">At other times and in other civilizations, this path of spiritual transformation was confined to a relatively select number of people; now, however, a large proportion of the human race must seek the path of wisdom if the world is to be preserved from the internal and external dangers that threaten it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In this time of violence and disintegration, spiritual vision is not an elitist luxury but vital to our survival. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To follow the path of wisdom has never been more urgent or more difficult. Our society is dedicated almost entirely to the celebration of ego, with all its sad fantasies about success and power, and it celebrates those very forces of greed and ignorance that are destroying the planet. It has never been more difficult to hear the unflattering voice of the truth, and never more difficult, once having heard it, to follow it: because there is nothing in the world around us that supports our choice, and the entire society in which we live seems to negate every idea of sacredness or eternal meaning. So at the time of our most acute danger, when our very future is in doubt, we as human beings find ourselves at our most bewildered, and trapped in a nightmare of our own creation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet there is one significant source of hope in this tragic situation, and that is that the spiritual teachings of all the great mystical traditions are still available. Unfortunately, however, there are very few masters to embody them, and an almost total lack of discrimination in those searching for the truth. The West has become a heaven for spiritual charlatans. In the case of scientists, you can verify who is genuine and who is not, because other scientists can check their background and test their find-ings. Yet in the West, without the guidelines and criteria of a thriving and full-fledged wisdom culture, the authenticity of so-called "masters" is almost impossible to establish. Anyone, it seems, can parade as a master and attract a following. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This was not the case in Tibet, where choosing a particular path or teacher to follow was far safer. People coming to Tibetan Buddhism for the first time often wonder why such great importance is placed on lineage, on the unbroken chain of transmission from master to master. Lineage serves as a crucial safeguard: It maintains the authenticity and purity of the teaching. People know who a master is from who <i class="calibre3"> his</i> master is. It is not a question of preserving some fossilized, ritualistic knowledge, but of transmitting from heart to heart, from mind to mind, an essential and living wisdom and its skillful and powerful methods. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 3 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Recognizing who is and who is not a true master is a very subtle and demanding business; and in an age like ours, addicted to entertainment, easy answers, and quick fixes, the more sober and untheatrical attributes of spiritual mastery might very well go unnoticed. Our ideas about what holiness is, that it is pious, bland, and meek, may make us blind to the dynamic and sometimes exuberantly playful manifestation of the enlightened mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As Patrul Rinpoche wrote: "The extraordinary qualities of great beings who hide their nature escapes ordinary people like us, despite our best efforts in examining them. On the other hand, even ordinary charlatans are expert at deceiving others by behaving like saints." If Patrul Rinpoche could write that in the nineteenth century in Tibet, how much more true must it be in the chaos of our contemporary spiritual supermarket? </p>
<p class="calibre2">So how are we today, in an extremely distrustful age, to find the trust that is so necessary in following the spiritual path? What criteria can we use to assess whether or not a master is genuine? </p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember vividly being with a master whom I know when he asked his students what had drawn them to him, and why they had trusted him. One woman said: "I've come to see how you really want, more than anything, for us to understand and apply the teachings, and how skillfully you direct them to help us do so." A man in his fifties said: "It's not what you know that moves me, but that you really do have an altruistic and a good heart." </p>
<p class="calibre2">A woman in her late thirties confessed: "I've tried to make you into my mother, my father, my therapist, my husband, my lover; you have calmly sat through the drama of all these projections and never ever turned away from me." </p>
<p class="calibre2">An engineer in his twenties said: "What I have found in you is that you are genuinely humble, that you really wish the very best for all of us, that as well as being a teacher you have never stopped being a student of your great masters." A young lawyer said: "For you it's the teachings that are the most important thing. Sometimes I even think that your ideal would be almost for <i class="calibre3"> you</i> to become completely obsolete, simply to pass on the teachings as selflessly as possible." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another student said shyly: "At first I was terrified at opening myself up to you. I've been hurt so often. But as I began to do so, I started to notice real changes in myself, and slowly I became more and more grateful to you, because I realized how much you were helping me. And then I discovered in 134 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">myself a trust in you so deep, deeper than I'd ever imagined possible." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally a computer operator in his forties said: "You have been such a wonderful mirror for me, and you show me two things: the relative aspect of who I am, and the absolute aspect of who I am. I can look at you and see—not because of who you are but because of what you are mirroring back to me—all of my relative confusion, very clearly. But I can also look at you and I can see, reflected in you, the nature of mind, out of which everything is arising, moment by moment." </p>
<p class="calibre2">These replies show us that true teachers are kind,  <i class="calibre3"> compassionate, </i> and tireless in their desire to share whatever wisdom they have acquired from their masters, never abuse or manipulate their students under any circumstances, never under any circumstances abandon them, serve not their own ends but the greatness of the teachings, and always remain humble. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Real trust can and should only grow toward someone who you come to know, over time, embodies all these qualities. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You will find that this trust becomes the ground of your life, there to support you through all the difficulties of life and death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Buddhism we establish whether a teacher is authentic by whether or not the guidance he or she is giving accords with the teaching of Buddha. It cannot be stressed too often that it is <i class="calibre3"> the truth of the teaching</i> which is all-important, and never the personality of the teacher. This is why Buddha reminded us in the "Four Reliances": </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Rely on the message of the teacher, not on his personality;</i> <i class="calibre3">Rely on the meaning, not just on the words;</i> <i class="calibre3">Rely on the real meaning, not on the provisional one;</i> <i class="calibre3">Rely on your wisdom mind, not on your ordinary, judgmental</i> <i class="calibre3">mind. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is important to remember that the true teacher, as we shall see,  <i class="calibre3"> is</i> the spokesperson of the truth: its compassionate </p>
<p class="calibre2">"wisdom display." All the buddhas, masters, and prophets, in fact, are the emanations of this truth, appearing in countless skillful, compassionate guises in order to guide us, through their teaching, back to our true nature. At first, then, more important than finding the teacher is finding and following the truth of the teaching, for it is through making a connection with the truth of the teaching that you will discover your living connection with a master. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH 135 </p>
<p class="calibre2">HOW TO FOLLOW THE PATH </p>
<p class="calibre2">We all have the karma to meet one spiritual path or another, and I would encourage you, from the bottom of my heart, to follow with complete sincerity the path that inspires you most. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Read the great spiritual books of all the traditions, come to some understanding of what the masters might mean by liberation and enlightenment, and find out which approach to absolute reality really attracts and suits you most. Exercise in your search as much discernment as you can; the spiritual path demands more intelligence, more sober understanding, more subtle powers of discrimination than any other discipline, because the highest truth is at stake. Use your common sense at every moment. Come to the path as humorously aware as possible of the baggage you will be bringing with you: your lacks, fantasies, failings, and projections. Blend, with a soaring awareness of what your true nature might be, a down-to-earth and level-headed humility, and a clear appreciation of where you are on your spiritual journey and what still remains to be understood and accomplished. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important thing is not to get trapped in what I see everywhere in the West, a "shopping mentality": shopping around from master to master, teaching to teaching, without any continuity or real, sustained dedication to any one discipline. Nearly all the great spiritual masters of all traditions agree that the essential thing is to master one way, one path to the truth, by following one tradition with all your heart and mind to the end of the spiritual journey, while remaining open and respectful toward the insights of all others. In Tibet we used to say, "Knowing one, you accomplish all." The modern faddish idea that we can always keep all our options open and so never need commit ourselves to anything is one of the greatest and most dangerous delusions of our culture, and one of ego's most effective ways of sabotaging our spiritual search. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you go on searching all the time, the searching itself becomes an obsession and takes you over. You become a spiritual tourist, bustling about and never getting anywhere. As Patrul Rinpoche says, "You leave your elephant at home and look for its footprints in the forest." Following one teaching is not a way of confining you or jealously monopolizing you. It's a compassionate and skillful way of keeping you centered and always on the path, despite all the obstacles that you and the world will inevitably present. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">136 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">So when you have explored the mystical traditions, choose one master and follow him or her. It's one thing to set out on the spiritual journey; its quite another to find the patience and endurance, the wisdom, courage, and humility to follow it to the end. You may have the karma to find a teacher, but you must then create the karma to follow your teacher. For very few of us know how truly to follow a master, which is an art in itself. So however great the teaching or master may be, what is essential is that you find in yourself the insight and skill to learn how to love and follow the master and the teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not easy. Things will never be perfect. How could they be? We are still in samsara. Even when you have chosen your master and are following the teachings as sincerely as you can, you will often meet difficulties and frustrations, contradictions and imperfections. Don't succumb to obstacles and tiny difficulties. These are often only ego's childish emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't let them blind you to the essential and enduring value of what you have chosen. Don't let your impatience drag you away from your commitment to the truth. I have been sad-dened, again and again, to see how many people take up a teaching or master with enthusiasm and promise, only to lose heart when the smallest, unavoidable obstacles arise, then tumble back into samsara and old habits and waste years or perhaps a lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As the Buddha said in his first teaching, the root of all our suffering in samsara is <i class="calibre3"> ignorance. </i> Ignorance, until we free ourselves from it, can seem endless, and even when we have embarked on the spiritual path our search is fogged by it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if you remember this and keep the teachings in your heart, you will gradually develop the discernment to recognize the innumerable confusions of ignorance for what they are, and so never jeopardize your commitment or lose your perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Life, as the Buddha told us, is as brief as a lightning flash; yet as Wordsworth said, "The world is too much with us: getting and spending, we lay waste our powers." It is that laying waste of our powers, that betrayal of our essence, that abandonment of the miraculous chance that this life, the natural bardo, gives us of knowing and embodying our enlightened nature, that is perhaps the most heartbreaking thing about human life. What the masters are essentially telling us is to stop fooling ourselves: What will we have learned, if at the moment of death we do not know who we really are? As the <i class="calibre3">Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 3 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">With mind far off, not thinking of death's coming,</i> <i class="calibre3">Performing these meaningless activities, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Returning empty-handed now would be complete confusion;</i> <i class="calibre3">The need is recognition, the spiritual teachings,</i> <i class="calibre3">So why not practice the path of wisdom at this very moment? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">From the mouths of the saints come these words:</i> <i class="calibre3">If you do not keep your master's teaching in your heart</i> <i class="calibre3">Will you not become your own deceiver? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MASTER </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Buddha says in one of the Tantras:1 "Of all the buddhas who have ever attained enlightenment, not a single one accomplished this without relying upon a master, and of all the thousand buddhas that will appear in this eon, none of them will attain enlightenment without relying on a master." </p>
<p class="calibre2">In 1987, after my beloved master Dudjom Rinpoche passed away in France, I was sitting in a train, returning to Paris from the south of France, where he had lived. Images of his thousands of acts of generosity, tenderness, and compassion passed through my mind; I found myself in tears, saying to myself over and over again: "Had it not been for you, how could I possibly have understood?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">I realized, with an intimacy and poignancy that I had never experienced before, just why such a sacred emphasis is placed in our tradition on the relationship between master and disciple, and just how essential this relationship is to the living transmission of the truth, from mind to mind, from heart to heart. Without my masters, I would have had no possibility at all of realizing the truth of the teachings: I cannot imagine even having been able to reach the humble level of understanding that I have. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Many people in the West are suspicious of masters—often, unfortunately, for good reasons. I do not have to catalogue here the many dreadful and disappointing cases of folly, greed, and charlatanry that have occurred in the modern world since the opening to Eastern wisdom in the 1950s and 1960s. However, all the great wisdom traditions, whether Christian, Sufi, Buddhist, or Hindu, rely for their force on the master-disciple relationship. And so what the world needs urgently now is as clear as possible an understanding of what a real master is, what a real student or disciple is, and what the true nature of the transformation is that takes place through devotion to the master, what you might call "the alchemy of discipleship." </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">138 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps the most moving and accurate account of the true nature of the master I have ever heard comes from my master Jamyang Khyentse. He said that although our true nature is buddha, it has been obscured from beginningless time by a dark cloud of ignorance and confusion. This true nature, however, our buddha nature, has never completely surrendered to the tyranny of ignorance; somewhere it is always rebelling against its domination. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our buddha nature, then, has an active aspect, which is our </p>
<p class="calibre2">"inner teacher." From the very moment we became obscured, this inner teacher has been working tirelessly for us, tirelessly trying to bring us back to the radiance and spaciousness of our true being. Not for one second, Jamyang Khyentse said, has the inner teacher given up on us. In its infinite compassion, one with the infinite compassion of all the buddhas and all the enlightened beings, it has been ceaselessly working for our evolution—not only in this life but in all our past lives also— </p>
<p class="calibre2">using all kinds of skillful means and all types of situations to teach and awaken us, and to guide us back to the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When we have prayed and aspired and hungered for the truth for a long time, for many, many lives, and when our karma has become sufficiently purified, a kind of miracle takes place. And this miracle, if we can understand and use it, can lead to the ending of ignorance forever: The inner teacher, who has been with us always, manifests in the form of the "outer teacher," whom, almost as if by magic, we actually encounter. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This encounter is the most important of any lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Who is this outer teacher? None other than the embodiment and voice and representative of our inner teacher. The master whose human shape and human voice and wisdom we come to love with a love deeper than any other in our lives is none other than the external manifestation of the mystery of our own inner truth. What else could explain why we feel so strongly connected to him or her? </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the deepest and highest level, the master and the disciple are not and cannot ever be in any way separate; for the master's task is to teach us to receive, without any obscuration of any kind, the clear message of our own inner teacher, and to bring us to realize the continual presence of this ultimate teacher within us. I pray that all of you may taste, in this life, the joy of this most perfect kind of friendship. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only is the master the direct spokesperson of your own inner teacher, he or she is also the bearer, channel, and transmitter of all the blessings of all the enlightened beings. That is THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 3 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">what gives your master the extraordinary power to illumine your mind and heart. He or she is nothing less than the human face of the absolute, the telephone, if you like, through which all the buddhas and all the enlightened beings can call you. He or she is the crystallization of the wisdom of all the buddhas, and the embodiment of their compassion directed always toward you: the rays of their universal sunlight aimed directly at your heart and mind in order to liberate you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In my tradition we revere the master for being even kinder than the buddhas themselves. Although the compassion and power of the buddhas are always present, our obscurations prevent us from meeting the buddhas face to face. But we <i class="calibre3"> can</i> meet the master; he or she is here, living, breathing, speaking, acting, before us to show us, in all the ways possible, the path of the buddhas: the way to liberation. For me, my masters have been the embodiment of living truth, undeniable signs that enlightenment is possible in a body, in this life, in this world, even here and even now, the supreme inspirations in my practice, in my work, in my life, and in my journey toward liberation. My masters are for me the embodiments of my sacred commitment to keep enlightenment foremost in my mind until I actually achieve it. I know enough to know that only when I reach enlightenment will I have a complete understanding of who they really are and of their infinite generosity, love, and wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to share with you this beautiful prayer, the words of Jikme Lingpa, a prayer we say in Tibet to invoke the presence of the master in our heart: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">From the blossoming lotus of devotion, at the center of my heart,</i> <i class="calibre3">Rise up, O compassionate master, my only refuge! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I am plagued by past actions and turbulent emotions:</i> <i class="calibre3">To protect me in my misfortune </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Remain as the jewel-ornament on the crown of my head, the</i> <i class="calibre3">chakra of great bliss, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Arousing all my mindfulness and awareness, I pray! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE ALCHEMY OF DEVOTION </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as Buddha said that of all the buddhas who attained enlightenment, not one accomplished this without relying on the master, he also said: "It is only through devotion, and devotion alone, that you will realize the absolute truth." The absolute truth cannot be realized within the domain of the 140 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">ordinary mind. And th e path beyond th e ordinary mind, all the great wisdom traditions have told us, is through the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This path of th e heart is devotion . </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche wrote : </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There is only one way of attaining liberation and of obtaining the</i> <i class="calibre3">omniscience of enlightenment: following an authentic spiritual master. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">He is the guide that will help you to cross the ocean of samsara. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The sun and the moon are reflected in clear, still water</i> <i class="calibre3">instantly. Similarly, the blessings of all the buddhas are always</i> <i class="calibre3">present for those who have complete confidence in them.

<p class="calibre2">So then, it is essential to know wha t real devotio n is. It is not mindless adoration; it is not abdication of your responsibility to yourself , nor  undiscriminating following of another's personality or  whim . Real devotio n is an unbroken receptivity to th e truth. Real devotio n is rooted in an awed and reverent gratitude, bu t one tha t is lucid, grounded, and intelligent. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whe n th e maste r  is able to open your  innermost heart and offers you an undeniably powerful glimpse of th e nature of your  mind , a wave of joyful gratitude surges up in you toward th e one wh o helpe d you to see, an d th e truth tha t you now realiz e th e master  embodies in his or  her  being , teachings, an d wisdom mind.

<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche tells us, </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">At first this devotion may not be natural or spontaneous, so we</i> <i class="calibre3">must employ a variety of techniques to help us to achieve this. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 4 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Chiefly we must always remember the excellent qualiies ofthe</i> <i class="calibre3">teacher, especially his kindness to us. By repeatedly generating</i> <i class="calibre3">confidence, appreciation to the guru, and devotion toward him, a</i> <i class="calibre3">time will come when the mere mention of his name or the thought</i> <i class="calibre3">of him will stop all our ordinary perceptions, and we will see him</i> <i class="calibre3">as the Buddha himself2 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">To see the master not as a human being, but as the Buddha himself, is the source of the highest blessing. As Padmasambhava says: "Complete devotion brings complete blessing; absence of doubts brings complete success." The Tibetans know that if you relate to your teacher as a buddha, you will receive the blessing of a buddha, but if you relate to your master as a human being, you will only get the blessing of a human being. So to receive the full transformative power of the blessing of his or her teaching, the complete unfolding of its glory, you must try and unfold in yourself the richest possible kind of devotion. Only if you come to see your master as a buddha can a buddha-like teaching come through to you from your master's wisdom mind. If you cannot recognize your master as a buddha, but see him or her as a human being, the full blessing can never be there, and even the greatest teaching will leave you somewhere unreceptive. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The more I come to reflect on devotion and its place and role in the overall vision of the teachings, the more deeply I realize that it is essentially a skillful and powerful means of making us more receptive to the truth of the master's teaching. Masters themselves do not need our adoration, but seeing them as living buddhas will enable us to listen to and hear their message and to follow their instructions with the greatest possible fidelity. Devotion, then, is in one sense the most practical way of ensuring a total respect for, and therefore openness to, the teachings, as embodied by the master and transmitted through him or her. The more devoted you are, the more open you are to the teachings; the more open you are to the teachings, the more chance there is for them to penetrate your heart and mind, and so bring about a complete spiritual transformation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is only by seeing your master as a living buddha that the process of transformation of yourself into a living buddha can be truly begun and truly accomplished. When your mind and heart are fully open in joy and wonder and recognition and gratitude to the mystery of the living presence of enlightenment in the master, then slowly, over many years, 142 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">transmission from the master's wisdom mind and heart to yours can take place, revealing to you the full splendor of your own buddha nature, and with it the perfect splendor of the universe itself. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This most intimate relationship between disciple and master becomes a mirror, a living analogy for the disciple's relationship to life and the world in general. The master becomes the pivotal figure in a sustained practice of "pure vision," </p>
<p class="calibre2">which culminates when the disciple sees direcdy and beyond any doubt: the master as the living buddha, his or her every word as buddha speech, his or her mind the wisdom mind of all the buddhas, his or her every action an expression of buddha activity, the place where he or she lives as nothing less than a buddha realm, and even those around the master as a luminous display of his or her wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As these perceptions become more and more stable and actual, the inner miracle disciples have longed for over so many lives can gradually take place: They begin to see naturally that they, the universe, and all beings without exception are spontaneously pure and perfect. They are looking at last at reality with its own eyes. The master, then,  <i class="calibre3"> is</i> the path, the magical touchstone for a total transformation of the disciple's every perception. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Devotion becomes the purest, quickest, and simplest way to realize the nature of our mind and all things. As we progress in it, the process reveals itself as wonderfully interdependent: We, from our side, try continually to generate devotion, the devotion we arouse itself generates glimpses of the nature of mind, and these glimpses only enhance and deepen our devotion to the master who is inspiring us. So in the end devotion springs out of wisdom: devotion and the living experience of the nature of mind become inseparable and inspire one another. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The teacher of Patrul Rinpoche was called Jikme Gyalwe Nyugu. For many years he had been doing a solitary retreat in a cave in the mountains. One day when he came outside, the sun was pouring down; he gazed out into the sky and saw a cloud moving in the direction of where his master, Jikme Lingpa, lived. The thought rose in his mind, "Over there is where my master is," and with that thought a tremendous feeling of longing and devotion surged up in him. It was so strong, so shattering, that he fainted. When Jikme Gyalwe Nyugu came to, the entire blessing of his master's wisdom mind had been transmitted to him, and he had reached the THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 4 3 </p>

<p class="calibre2">THE STREA M OF BLESSINGS </p>
<p class="calibre2">Such stories abou t th e power  of devotio n an d th e blessin g of th e maste r  do not merel y belon g to th e past. In a figur e like Khandro Tsering Chodron, th e greatest  woma n maste r  of our day, wh o wa s th e wife of my master Jamyang Khyentse, you see ver y clearly wha t years of th e deepes t devotio n an d prac -</p>
<p class="calibre2">tice can create out of th e huma n spirit. Her  humility and beauty of heart, an d th e shining simplicity, modesty, and lucid, tender  wisdom of her  presence ar e honored by all Tibetans, even though she herself ha s tried as far  as possible to remain in th e background, never  to push herself forward, and to live th e hidden and austere life of an ancien t contemplative. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Jamyang Khyentse has been the inspiration of Khandro s entire life. It wa s her  spiritual marriage to him that transformed her  from a ver y beautiful and slightl y rebellious youn g woman into th e radiant dakini3 tha t other great masters hold in th e highes t regard. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche looked to her as a "spiritual mother, "  an d alway s used to say ho w privilege d he felt that of all the Lamas she revered and loved him most deeply. Whenever  he used to see Khandro, he would take her hand an d tenderly caress it, and the n slowly place it on his head; he kne w that  wa s th e only wa y he could ever  get Khandro to bless him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Jamyang Khyentse gave Khandro all the teachings, and trained her  and inspired her  to practice. Her  questions to him would be in th e form of songs, and he would write songs bac k to her, in an almos t teasing and playful way. Khandro ha s demonstrated her  undying devotion to her  master  by continuing to live after  his death in th e plac e in Sikkim where he lived toward th e end of his life, where he died , an d where his relics ar e kept, enshrined in a stupa.4 There, near  him , she car -</p>

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche used to say tha t ever y tim e he wen t back to th e stupa of Jamyang Khyentse, he felt as if he wer e coming home, because Khandro's presence mad e th e atmosphere so rich an d warm. It wa s as if, he implied , my maste r Jamyang Khyentse wa s still present an d still alive, in her  devotion an d her  being . </p>

<p class="calibre2">144 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Again and again, I have heard Khandro say that if your link with your master is kept really pure, then everything will go well in your life. Her own life is the most moving and exquisite example of this. Devotion has enabled her to embody the heart of the teachings and radiate their warmth to others. Khandro does not teach in a formal way; in fact, she does not speak a great deal; but what she does say can often be so penetratingly clear that it becomes prophetic. To listen to her fervent and blissful chanting, or to practice with her, is to be inspired to the depths of your being. Even to walk with her, or shop, or simply sit with her is to bathe in the powerful, quiet happiness of her presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Khandro is so retiring, and because her greatness is in her ordinariness, only those with real insight see who she is. We live in a time when those who thrust themselves forward are frequently admired the most, but it is in the humble, like Khandro, that the truth really lives. And if Khandro were ever to teach in the West, she would be a perfect master: the very greatest kind of woman master, one who incarnates with a mysterious completeness the love and healing wisdom of Tara, enlightened compassion in its female form. If I were to die, and Khandro were there next to me, I would feel more confident and more at peace than if any other master were by my side. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All that I have realized I have realized through devotion to my masters. Increasingly, as I go on teaching, I become aware, humbly and with real awe, of how their blessings are beginning to work through me. I am nothing without their blessing, and if there is anything I feel I can do, it is acting as a bridge between you and them. Again and again, I notice that when I speak of my masters in my teaching, my devotion to them inspires a vision of devotion in those listening; and in those marvelous moments I feel my masters are present, blessing and opening the hearts of my students to the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember in Sikkim in the 1960s, not long after my master Jamyang Khyentse had died, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was giving a long set of initiations, the visionary teachings of Padmasambhava, which can take several months to bestow. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Many masters were there in a monastery in the hills behind Gangtok, the capital, and I was sitting with Khandro Tsering THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 4 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Chodron and Lama Chokden, Jamyang Khyentse's assistant an d maste r  of ceremonies . </p>
<p class="calibre2">It wa s then tha t I experienced, in th e most vivid way, th e truth of ho w a master  can transmit th e blessing of his wisdom min d to a student. On e da y Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche gave a teaching abou t devotio n an d abou t our  maste r  Jamyang Khyentse, which wa s extraordinarily moving ; th e words flowed from him in a torrent of eloquence an d th e purest spiritual poetry. Again and again , as I listene d to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and watched him , I wa s reminded in th e most mysterious wa y of Jamyang Khyentse himself, an d how he ha d been able simply to spea k an d pou r  out , as if from a hidden inexhaustible source, the most exalted teaching. Slowly I realized, with wonder , wha t ha d happened: th e blessin g of th e wisdom mind of Jamyang Khyentse had been transmitted completely to his heart-son Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, an d wa s now, before us all, speaking effortlessly through him . </p>
<p class="calibre2">At th e end of th e teaching, I turned to Khandro an d Chokden, an d I saw tears streaming down thei r  faces. "W e kne w tha t Dilgo Khyentse wa s a grea t master, "  the y said , "and we kno w ho w it is said that a maste r  will transmit th e entire blessing of his wisdom min d to his heart-son. But it is only now, only today , only here , tha t we realize wha t thi s trul y means." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking again of that wonderful da y in Sikkim , and of thos e grea t masters I hav e known, thes e words of a Tibetan sain t tha t hav e alway s inspired me return to me: "When th e sun of fierce devotio n shines on th e sno w mountain of th e master, th e stream of his blessings will pou r  down, "  and I remember  th e words of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche himself, which express perhaps more eloquently than an y othe r  pas -</p>
<p class="calibre2">sage I kno w th e vast and nobl e qualities of th e master: <i class="calibre3">He is like a great ship for beings to cross the perilous ocean of</i> <i class="calibre3">existence, an unerring captain who guides them to the dry land of</i> <i class="calibre3">liberation, a rain that extinguishes the fire of the passions, a bright</i> <i class="calibre3">sun and moon that dispel the darkness of ignorance, a firm ground</i> <i class="calibre3">that can bear the weight of both good and bad, a wish-fulfilling</i> <i class="calibre3">tree that bestows temporal happiness and ultimate bliss, a treasury</i> <i class="calibre3">of vast and deep instructions, a wish-fulfilling jewel granting all</i> <i class="calibre3">the qualiies of realization, a father and a mother giving their love</i> <i class="calibre3">equally to all sentient beings, a great river of compassion, a mountain rising above worldly concerns unshaken by the winds of emotions, and a great cloud filled with rain to soothe the torments of</i> 146 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">the passions. In brief, he is the equal of all the buddhas. To make</i> <i class="calibre3">any connection with him, whether through seeing him, hearing his</i> <i class="calibre3">voice, remembering him, or being touched by his hand, will lead us</i> <i class="calibre3">toward liberation. To have fill confidence in him is the sure way to</i> <i class="calibre3">progress toward enlightenment. The warmth of his wisdom and</i> <i class="calibre3">compassion will melt the ore of our being and release the gold of</i> <i class="calibre3">the buddha-nature within.5 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have become aware of the blessings of my masters trickling down to me almost imperceptibly and informing my mind. Ever since Dudjom Rinpoche died, my students tell me my teachings became more flowing, more lucid. Not long ago, after hearing Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche give a particularly astonishing teaching, I expressed my deep admiration for him and said: "It's almost miraculous how effortlessly and spontaneously these teachings flow from your wisdom mind." He leaned toward me tenderly, with a teasing glint in his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"And may your teachings in English flow in exactly the same way," he said. Since then, through no doing of my own, I have felt my ability to express the teachings grow more and more natural. I consider this book to be a manifestation of the blessing of my masters, transmitted through the wisdom mind of the ultimate master and supreme guide, Padmasambhava. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This book, then, is their gift to you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is my devotion to my masters that gives me the strength to teach, and the openness and receptivity to learn and go on learning. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche himself never stopped humbly receiving teachings from other masters, and often those who were his own disciples. The devotion that gives the inspiration to teach, then, is also the devotion that gives the humility to go on learning. Gampopa, Milarepa's greatest disciple, asked him, at the moment of their parting, "When will be the time for me to start guiding students?" Milarepa replied, "When you are not like you are now, when your whole perception has been transformed, and you are able to see, really see, this old man before you as nothing less than the Buddha himself. When devotion has brought you to that moment of recognition, that moment will be the sign that the time for you to teach has come." </p>
<p class="calibre2">These teachings have been brought to you from Padmasambhava's enlightened heart, across centuries, over a thousand years, by an unbroken lineage of masters, each one of whom only became masters because they had learned humbly to be disciples, and remained, in the deepest sense, disciples of THE SPIRITUAL PATH<b class="calibre4">  1 4 7 </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">their masters all their Hves. Even at the age of eighty-two, when Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche spoke of his master Jamyang Khyentse, tears of gratitude and devotion came to his eyes. In his last letter to me before he died, he signed himself "the worst disciple." </p>
<p class="calibre2">That showed me how endless true devotion is, how with the greatest possible realization comes the greatest devotion and the most complete, because the most humble, gratitude. </p>
<p class="calibre2">GURU YOGA: MERGING WITH </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE WISDOM MIND OF THE MASTER<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and enlightened beings are present at all moments to help us, and it is through the presence of the master that all of their blessings are focused directly at us. Those who know Padmasambhava know the living truth of the promise he made over a thousand years ago: "I am never far from those with faith, or even from those without it, though they do not see me. My children will always, always, be protected by my compassion." </p>
<p class="calibre2">All we need to do to receive direct help is to ask. Didn't Christ also say: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you. Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth"?6 And yet asking is what we find hardest. Many of us, I feel, hardly know <i class="calibre3"> how</i> to ask. Sometimes it is because we are arrogant, sometimes because we are unwilling to seek help, sometimes because we are lazy, sometimes our minds are so busy with questions, distractions, and confusion that the simplicity of asking does not occur to us. The turning point in any healing of alcoholics or drug addicts is when they admit their illness and ask for aid. In one way or another, we are all addicts of samsara; the moment when help can come for us is when we admit our addiction and simply ask. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What most of us need, almost more than anything, is the courage and humility really to ask for help, from the depths of our hearts: to ask for the compassion of the enlightened beings, to ask for purification and healing, to ask for the power to understand the meaning of our suffering and transform it; at a <i class="calibre3"> relative</i> level to ask for the growth in our lives of clarity, of peace, of discernment, and to ask for the realization of the <i class="calibre3"> absolute</i> nature of mind that comes from merging with the deathless wisdom mind of the master. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no swifter, more moving, or more powerful practice for invoking the help of the enlightened beings, for arousing 148 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">devotion and realizing the nature of mind, than the practice of Guru Yoga. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche wrote, "The words Guru Yoga mean 'union with the nature of the guru and in this practice we are given methods by which we can blend our own minds with the enlightened mind of the master." 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember that the master—the guru—embodies the crystallization of the blessings of all buddhas, masters, and enlightened beings. So to invoke him or her is to invoke them all; and to merge your mind and heart with your master's wisdom mind is to merge your mind with the truth and very embodiment of enlightenment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The outer teacher introduces you directly to the truth of your inner teacher. The more it is revealed through his or her teaching and inspiration, the more you begin to realize that outer and inner teacher are indivisible. As you gradually discover the truth of this for yourself, by invoking it again and again in the practice of Guru Yoga, a deepening confidence, gratitude, joy, and devotion are born in you, through which your mind and the wisdom mind of the master do actually become indivisible. In a Guru Yoga practice he composed at my request, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche wrote: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That which accomplishes the great purity of perception</i> <i class="calibre3">Is devotion, which is the radiance of Rigpa. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Recognizing and remembering that my own Rigpa is the master</i>— </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Through this, may your mind and mine merge as one. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">This is why all the wisdom traditions of Tibet have placed so much importance on the practice of Guru Yoga, and all the foremost Tibetan masters have treasured it as their innermost heart practice. Dudjom Rinpoche wrote: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is vital to put all your energy into the Guru Yogi, holding onto it</i> <i class="calibre3">as the life and heart of the practice. If you do not, then your meditation will be very dull, and even if you do make a little progress,</i> <i class="calibre3">there will be no end to obstacles, and no possibility of true, genuine</i> <i class="calibre3">realization being born within the mind. So by fervently praying with</i> <i class="calibre3">uncontrived devotion, after a while the direct blessing of the wisdom</i> <i class="calibre3">mind of the master will be transmitted, empowering you with a</i> <i class="calibre3">unique realization, beyond words, born deep within your mind. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">What I would like to give you now is a simple practice of Guru Yoga that anyone, whatever their religion or spiritual belief, can do. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH  1 4 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">This wonderful practice is my main practice, the heart and inspiration of my whole life, and whenever I do the Guru Yoga, it is Padmasambhava that I focus on. As Buddha himself was passing away, he prophesied that Padmasambhava would be born not long after his death in order to spread the teaching of the Tantras. It was Padmasambhava, as I have said, who established Buddhism in Tibet in the eighth century. For us Tibetans, Padmasambhava, Guru Rinpoche, embodies a cosmic, timeless principle; he is the universal master. He has appeared countless times to the masters of Tibet, and these meetings and visions have been precisely recorded: the date, the place, and manner in which they occurred, along with the teachings and prophecies Padmasambhava gave. He also left thousands of visionary teachings for future times, which have been revealed again and again by the many great masters who have been his emanations; one of these visionary treasures, or <i class="calibre3">termas, </i> is the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have always turned to Padmasambhava in times of difficulty and crisis, and his blessing and power have never failed me. When I think of him, all my masters are embodied in him. To me he is completely alive at all moments, and the whole universe, at each moment, shines with his beauty, strength, and presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">O Guru Rinpoche, Precious One, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">You are the embodiment of </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The compassion and blessings of all the buddhas,</i> <i class="calibre3">The only protector of beings. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">My body, my possessions, my heart and soul</i> <i class="calibre3">Without hesitation, I surrender to you! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">From now until I attain enlightenment, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">In happiness or sorrow, in circumstances good or bad, in situations</i> <i class="calibre3">high or low: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">1 rely on you completely, O Padmasambhava, you who know me:</i> <i class="calibre3">think of me, inspire me, guide me, make me one with you!s</i> I consider Padmasambhava as the embodiment of all my masters, and so when I merge my mind with him in Guru Yoga, all of them are included within him. You can, however, use any enlightened being, saint, or master from any religion or mystical tradition for whom you feel devotion, whether they are alive or not. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This practice of Guru Yoga has four main phases: invocation; merging your mind with the master through his heart 150 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">essence, the mantra; receiving the blessing or empowerment; and uniting your mind with the master and resting in the nature of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1.  <i class="calibre3"> Invocation </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Sit quietly. From the depths of your heart, invoke in the sky in front of you the embodiment of the truth in the person of your master, a saint, or an enlightened being. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Try to visualize the master or buddha as alive, and as radiant and translucent as a rainbow. Believe, with complete trust, that all the blessings and qualities of the wisdom, compassion, and power of all the buddhas and enlightened beings are embodied in him or her. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you have difficulty visualizing the master, imagine this embodiment of truth simply as a being of light, or try to feel his or her perfect presence there in the sky before you: the presence of all the buddhas and masters. Let all the inspiration, joy, and awe you then feel take the place of visualization. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trust, simply, that the presence you are invoking <i class="calibre3"> is</i> really there. The Buddha himself said: "Whoever thinks of me, I am in front of them." My master Dudjom Rinpoche used to say that it does not matter if at the beginning you cannot visualize; what is more important is to feel the presence in your heart, and know that this presence embodies the blessings, compassion, energy, and wisdom of all the buddhas. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, relaxing and filling your heart with the master's presence, invoke him or her very strongly with all your heart and mind; with total trust, call upon him or her inwardly: "Help me, inspire me to purify all my karma and negative emotions, and to realize the true nature of my mind!" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, with deep devotion, merge your mind with the master, and rest your mind in his or her wisdom mind. And as you do so, give yourself up to the master completely, saying to yourself something like: "Help me, now. Take care of me. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Fill me with your joy and energy, your wisdom and compassion. Gather me into the loving heart of your wisdom mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Bless my mind; inspire my understanding." Then, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche says, "There is <i class="calibre3"> no doubt</i> that the blessing will enter your heart." </p>
<p class="calibre2">When we undertake this practice, it is a direct, skillful, and powerful way to carry us beyond our ordinary mind and into the pure realm of the wisdom of Rigpa. There, we recognize, come to discover, and acknowledge that all buddhas are present. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So, feeling the living presence of Buddha, of Padmasambhava, THE SPIRITUAL PATH 151 </p>
<p class="calibre2">of your master, and simply opening your heart and mind to the embodiment of truth, really does bless and transform your mind. As you invoke the Buddha, your own buddha nature is inspired to awaken and blossom, as naturally as a flower in sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Maturing and Deepening the Blessing </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I come to this part of the practice, merging my mind with the master through the mantra, I recite the mantra OM </p>
<p class="calibre2">AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM (pronounced by Tibetans: Om Ah Hung Benza Guru Pema Siddhi Hung), which I think of as actually <i class="calibre3"> being</i> Padmasambhava, and the blessing of all the masters, in the form of sound. I imagine my whole being filled with him, and I feel, as I recite the mantra— </p>
<p class="calibre2">which is his heart essence—that it vibrates and pervades me, as if hundreds of little Padmasambhavas in the form of sound were circulating inside me, transforming my whole being. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the mantra, then, offer your heart and soul in fervent and one-pointed devotion, and merge and mix and blend your mind with Padmasambhava or your master. Gradually you will feel yourself coming closer to Padmasambhava, and closing the gap between you and his wisdom mind. Slowly, through the blessing and power of this practice, you will find you actually experience your mind being transformed into the wisdom mind of Padmasambhava and the master: You begin to recognize their indivisibility. Just as if you put your finger into water, it will get wet, and if you put it into fire, it will burn, so if you invest your mind in the wisdom mind of the buddhas, it will transform into their wisdom nature. What happens is that gradually your mind begins to find itself in the state of Rigpa, as the innermost nature of mind <i class="calibre3"> is</i> nothing other than the wisdom mind of all the buddhas. It is as if your ordinary mind gradually dies and dissolves, and your pure awareness, your buddha nature, your inner teacher, is revealed. This is the true meaning of "blessing"—a transformation in which your mind transcends into the state of the absolute. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This "maturing of the blessing" is the heart and main part of the practice, to which you should devote the most time when you do the Guru Yoga practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3.  <i class="calibre3"> Empowerment </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine now that from the master thousands of brilliant rays of light stream out toward you, and penetrate you, 152 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">purifying, healing, blessing, empowering, and sowing in you the seeds of enlightenment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To make the practice as rich and inspiring as possible, you could imagine it unfolding in these three phases: First, dazzling light, crystal white in color, bursts out from the forehead of the master and enters the energy center in your forehead and fills your whole body. This white light represents the blessing of the body of all the buddhas: It cleanses all the negative karma you have accumulated through negative actions of the body; it purifies the subtle channels of your psycho-physical system; it gives you the blessing of the body of the buddhas; it empowers you for visualization practice; and it opens you to the realization of that compassionate energy of Rigpa, the nature of mind, that is manifesting in everything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Second, a stream of ruby red light shines out from the throat of the master into the energy center at your throat, filling your entire body. This red light represents the blessing of the speech of all the buddhas: it cleanses all the negative karma you have accumulated through harmful speech; it purifies the inner air of your psycho-physical system; it gives you the blessing of the speech of the buddhas; it empowers you for mantra practice; and it opens you to the realization of the radiance of the nature of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Third, a stream of shimmering blue light, the color of lapis lazuli, bursts out from the heart of the master into the energy center at your heart, and fills your whole body. This blue light represents the blessing of the mind of the buddhas: It cleanses all the negative karma you have accumulated through negative activity of your mind; it purifies the creative essence, or energy, within your psycho-physical system; it gives you the blessing of the mind of the buddhas; it empowers you for advanced yoga practices; and it opens you to the realization of the primordial purity of the essence of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Know and feel that you are now empowered, through the blessing, with the indestructible body, speech, and mind of Padmasambhava, of all the buddhas. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4 <i class="calibre3">. Resting in the Rigpa </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now let the master dissolve into light and become one with you, in the nature of your mind. Recognize beyond any doubt that this sky-like nature of your mind is the absolute master. Where else would all the enlightened beings be but in the Rigpa, in the nature of your mind? </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE SPIRITUAL PATH 153 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Secure in that realization, in a state of spacious and carefree ease, you rest in the warmth, glory, and blessing of your absolute nature. You have arrived at the original ground: the primordial purity of natural simplicity. As you rest in this state of Rigpa, you recognize the truth of Padmasambhava's words: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Mind itself is Padmasambhava; there is no practice or meditation apart from that." </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have given this practice here, as part of the natural bardo of this life, because this is the most important practice in life and so the most important practice at the moment of death. Guru Yoga, as you will see in Chapter 13, "Spiritual Help for the Dying," forms the basis of the practice of phowa, the transference of consciousness at the moment of death. For if, at the moment of death, you can unite your mind confidently with the wisdom mind of the master and die in that peace, then all, I promise and assure you, will be well. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our task in life, then, is to practice this merging with the wisdom mind of the master again and again, so that it becomes so natural that every activity—sitting, walking, eating, drinking, sleeping, dreaming, and waking—starts to be increasingly permeated by the master's living presence. Slowly, over years of focused devotion, you begin to know and realize all appearances to be the display of the wisdom of the master. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All the situations of life, even those that once seemed tragic, meaningless, or terrifying, reveal themselves more and more transparently to be the direct teaching and blessing of the master, and the inner teacher. As Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche says: <i class="calibre3">Devotion is the essence of the path, and if we have in mind nothing but the guru and feel nothing but fervent devotion, whatever</i> <i class="calibre3">occurs is perceived as his blessing. If we simply practice with this</i> <i class="calibre3">constantly present devotion, this is prayer itself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">When all thoughts are imbued with devotion to the guru, there</i> <i class="calibre3">is a natural confidence that this will take care of whatever may</i> <i class="calibre3">happen. All forms are the guru, all sounds are prayer, and all</i> <i class="calibre3">gross and subtle thoughts arise as devotion. Everything is spontaneously liberated in the absolute nature, like knots untied in the</i> <i class="calibre3">sky9 </i></p>
<p id="p110" class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">TEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Innermost Essence </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">NO ONE CAN DIE FEARLESSLY and in complete security until they have truly realized the nature of mind. For only this realization, deepened over years of sustained practice, can keep the mind stable during the molten chaos of the process of death. Of all the ways I know of helping people to realize the nature of mind, that of the practice of Dzogchen, the most ancient and direct stream of wisdom within the teachings of Buddhism, and the source of the bardo teachings themselves, is the clearest, most effective, and most relevant to the environment and needs of today. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The origins of Dzogchen are traced to the Primordial Buddha, Samantabhadra, from whom it has been handed down in an unbroken line of great masters to the present. Hundreds of thousands of individuals in India, the Himalayas, and Tibet have attained realization and enlightenment through its practice. There is a wonderful prophecy that "in this dark age, the heart essence of Samantabhadra will blaze like fire." My life, my teachings, and this book are dedicated to lighting this fire in the hearts and minds of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My constant support and inspiration and guide in this is the supreme master Padmasambhava. He is the essential spirit of Dzogchen, its greatest exponent and its human embodiment, with his glorious qualities of magnanimity, miraculous power, prophetic vision, awakened energy, and boundless compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dzogchen was not widely taught in Tibet, and for a while many of the greatest masters did not teach it in the modern world. Why then am I teaching it now? Some of my masters have told me that this <i class="calibre3"> is</i> the time for Dzogchen to spread, the time alluded to in the prophecy. I feel too that it would be uncompassionate not to share with people the existence of such an extraordinary wisdom. Human beings have come to a critical place in their evolution, and this age of extreme confu-154 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 5 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">sion demands a teaching of comparably extreme power and clarity. I have also found that modern people want a path shorn of dogma, fundamentalism, exclusivity, complex meta-physics, and culturally exotic paraphernalia, a path at once simple and profound, a path that does not need to be practiced in ashrams or monasteries but one that can be integrated with ordinary life and practiced anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So what, then, is Dzogchen? Dzogchen is not simply a teaching, not another philosophy, not another elaborate system, not a seductive clutch of techniques. Dzogchen is a state, <i class="calibre3">the</i> primordial state, that state of total awakening that is the heart-essence of all the buddhas and all spiritual paths, and the summit of an individual's spiritual evolution. Dzogchen is often translated as "Great Perfection." I prefer to leave it untranslated, for Great Perfection carries a sense of a perfect-ness we have to strive to attain, a goal that lies at the end of a long and grueling journey. Nothing could be further from the true meaning of Dzogchen: the <i class="calibre3"> already</i> self-perfected state of our primordial nature, which needs no "perfecting," for it has always been perfect from the very beginning, just like the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All the Buddhist teachings are explained in terms of </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ground, Path, and Fruition." The Ground of Dzogchen is this fundamental, primordial state, our absolute nature, which is already perfect and always present. Patrul Rinpoche says: "It is neither to be sought externally, nor is it something you did not have before and that now has to be newly born in your mind." So from the point of view of the Ground—the absolute—our nature is the same as the buddhas', and there is no question at this level, "not a hair's breadth," the masters say, of teaching or practice to do. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, we have to understand, the buddhas took one path and we took another. The buddhas recognize their original nature and become enlightened; we do not recognize that nature and so become confused. In the teachings, this state of affairs is called "One Ground, Two Paths." Our relative condition is that our intrinsic nature <i class="calibre3"> is</i> obscured, and we need to follow the teachings and practice in order to return us to the truth: This is the Path of Dzogchen. Finally, to realize our original nature is to attain complete liberation and become a buddha. This is the Fruition of Dzogchen and is actually possible, if a practitioner really puts his or her heart and mind to it, in one lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dzogchen masters are acutely aware of the dangers of confusing the absolute with the relative. People who fail to 156 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">understand this relationship can overlook and even disdain the relative aspects of spiritual practice and the karmic law of cause and effect. However, those who truly seize the meaning of Dzogchen will have only a deeper respect for karma, as well as a keener and more urgent appreciation of the need for purification and for spiritual practice. This is because they will understand the vastness of what it is in them that has been obscured, and so endeavor all the more fervently, and with an always fresh, natural discipline, to remove whatever stands between them and their true nature. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Dzogchen teachings are like a mirror that reflects the Ground of our original nature with such a soaring and liberating purity, and such a stainless clarity, that we are inherently safeguarded from being imprisoned in any form of conceptually fabricated understanding, however subtle, or convincing, or seductive. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What, then, for me is the wonder of Dzogchen? All of the teachings lead to enlightenment, but the uniqueness of Dzogchen is that even in the relative dimension of the teachings, the language of Dzogchen never stains the absolute with concepts; it leaves the absolute unspoiled in its naked, dynamic, majestic simplicity, and yet still speaks of it to anyone of an open mind in terms so graphic, so electric, that even before we become enlightened, we are graced with the strongest possible glimpse of the splendor of the awakened state. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre4">T H E VIEW </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The practical training of the Dzogchen Path is traditionally, and most simply, described in terms of View, Meditation, and Action. To see directly the absolute state, the Ground of our being, is the View; the way of stabilizing that View and making it an unbroken experience is Meditation; and integrating the View into our entire reality, and life, is what is meant by Action. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What then is the View? It is nothing less than <i class="calibre3"> seeing</i> the actual state of things as they are; it is <i class="calibre3"> knowing</i> that the true nature of mind is the true nature of everything; and it is <i class="calibre3"> realizing</i> that the true nature of our mind is the absolute truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dudjom Rinpoche says: "The View is the comprehension of the naked awareness, within which everything is contained: sensory perception and phenomenal existence, samsara and nirvana. This awareness has two aspects: 'emptiness' as the absolute, and appearances or perception as the relative." </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 5 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">What this means is that the entire range of all possible appearances, and all possible phenomena in all the different realities, whether samsara or nirvana, all of these without exception have always been and will always be perfect and complete, within the vast and boundless expanse of the nature of mind. Yet even though the essence of everything is empty and "pure from the very beginning," its nature is rich in noble qualities, pregnant with every possibility, a limitless, incessantly and dynamically creative field that is always spontaneously perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You might ask: "If realizing the View is realizing the nature of mind, what then is the nature of mind like?" Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its <i class="calibre3"> essence</i> is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its <i class="calibre3"> nature</i> is like this. Imagine that sun shining out impartially on us and all things, penetrating all directions; its <i class="calibre3"> energy, </i> which is the manifestation of compassion, is like this: nothing can obstruct it and it pervades everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You can also think of the nature of mind like a mirror, with five different powers or "wisdoms." Its openness and vastness is the "wisdom of all-encompassing space," the womb of compassion. Its capacity to reflect in precise detail whatever comes before it is the "mirror-like wisdom." Its fundamental lack of any bias toward any impression is the "equalizing wisdom." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Its ability to distinguish clearly, without confusing in any way the various different phenomena that arise, is the "wisdom of discernment." And its potential of having everything already accomplished, perfected, and spontaneously present is the "all-accomplishing wisdom." </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Dzogchen the View is introduced to the student directly by the master. It is the directness of this introduction that characterizes Dzogchen and makes it unique. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What is transmitted to the student in the introduction is the direct experience of the wisdom mind of the buddhas, through the blessing of a master who embodies its complete realization. To be able to receive the introduction, students have to have arrived at a point where, as a result of past aspirations and purified karma, they have both the openness of mind and devotion to make them receptive to the true meaning of Dzogchen. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How can the wisdom mind of the buddhas be introduced? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine the nature of mind as your own face; it is always 158 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">with you, but you cannot see it without help. Now imagine that you have never seen a mirror before. The introduction by the master is like suddenly holding up a mirror in which you can, for the first time, see your own face reflected. Just like your face, this pure awareness of Rigpa is not something </p>
<p class="calibre2">"new" that the master is giving you that you did not have before, nor is it something you could possibly find outside of yourself. It has always been yours, and has always been with you, but up until that startling moment you have never actually seen it directly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Patrul Rinpoche explains that, "According to the special tradition of the great masters of the practice lineage, the nature of mind, the face of Rigpa, is introduced upon the very dissolution of conceptual mind." In the moment of introduction, the master cuts through the conceptual mind altogether, laying bare the naked Rigpa and revealing explicitly its true nature. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In that powerful moment, a merging of minds and hearts takes place, and the student has an undeniable experience, or glimpse, of the nature of Rigpa. In one and the same moment the master introduces and the student recognizes. As the master directs his blessing from the wisdom of his Rigpa into the heart of the Rigpa of his student, the master shows the student directly the original face of the nature of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For the master's introduction to be fully effective, however, the right conditions or environment have to be created. Only a few special individuals in history, because of their purified karma, have been able to recognize and become enlightened in an instant; and so the introduction must almost always be preceded by the following preliminaries. It is these preliminaries that purify and peel away the ordinary mind and bring you to the state wherein your Rigpa can be revealed to you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">First, meditation, the supreme antidote to distraction, brings the mind home and enables it to settle into its natural state. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Second, deep practices of purification, and the strengthening of positive karma through the accumulation of merit and wisdom, start to wear away and dissolve the emotional and intellectual veils that obscure the nature of mind. As my master Jamyang Khyentse wrote: "If the obscurations are removed, the wisdom of one's own Rigpa will naturally shine." These purification practices, called <i class="calibre3"> Ngondro</i> in Tibetan, have been skillfully designed to effect a comprehensive inner transformation. They involve the entire being—body, speech, and mind— </p>
<p class="calibre2">and begin with a series of deep contemplations on THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 5 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">• the uniqueness of human life </p>
<p class="calibre2">• the ever-presence of impermanence and death </p>
<p class="calibre2">• the infallibility of the cause and effect of our actions </p>
<p class="calibre2">• the vicious cycle of frustration and suffering that is samsara. </p>
<p class="calibre2">These reflections inspire a strong sense of "renunciation," an urgent desire to emerge from samsara and follow the path to liberation, which forms the foundation for the specific practices of </p>
<p class="calibre2">• taking refuge in the Buddha, the truth of his teaching, and the example of its practitioners, and so awakening a confidence and trust in our own inner buddha nature </p>
<p class="calibre2">• giving birth to compassion <i class="calibre3"> (Bodhichitta</i>—the heart of the enlightened mind, which I shall explain in detail in Chapter 12) and training the mind to work with ourself and others and the difficulties of life </p>
<p class="calibre2">• removing obscurations and "defilements" through the visualization and mantra practice of purification and healing </p>
<p class="calibre2">• accumulating merit and wisdom by developing universal generosity and creating auspicious circumstances.1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">All these practices build up to and center around the Guru Yoga, which is the most crucial, moving and powerful practice of all, indispensable for opening the heart and mind to the realization of the state of Dzogchen.2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Third, a special meditative investigation into the nature of mind and phenomena exhausts the mind's restless hunger for thinking and research, and its dependence on endless conceptualizing, analysis, and references, and awakens a personal realization of the nature of emptiness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I cannot stress strongly enough how important these preliminaries are. They have to work hand in hand systematically, to inspire the student to awaken the nature of mind, and to enable the student to be ready and prepared when the master chooses the time to show him or her the original face of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one 160 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery.3 It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliandy. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of the mind?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: <i class="calibre3">He in whose heart the words of the master have entered,</i> <i class="calibre3">Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm.A</i> At that moment everything fell into place; the fruit of all Nyoshul Lungtok's years of learning, purification, and practice was born. He attained the realization of the nature of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There was nothing extraordinary or esoteric or mystical about the words Patrul Rinpoche used; in fact, they were extremely ordinary. But beyond the words something else was being communicated. What he was revealing was the inherent nature of everything, which is the true meaning of Dzogchen. At that moment he had already brought Nyoshul Lungtok directly into that state through the power and blessing of his realization. </p>

<p class="calibre2">But masters ar e ver y different, an d the y can use all kinds of skillful means to provoke tha t shift of consciousness. Patrul Rinpoche himself wa s introduced to th e nature of min d in a ver y different way, by a highly eccentric master  called Do Khyentse. Thi s is th e oral tradition I heard of thi s story. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Patrul Rinpoche ha d been doing an advanced practice of yoga an d visualization, and ha d become stuck ; none of th e mandalas of th e deitie s would appear clearl y in his mind. 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">One day he came upon Do Khyentse, who had made a fire out in th e open an d wa s sitting in front of it drinking tea . In Tibet  whe n you see a master for  who m you hav e deep devotion , traditionally you begin to prostrate your  bod y on th e ground as a mark of your  respect. As Patrul Rinpoche started prostrating from a distance, Do Khyentse spotted him and growled menacingly , "Hey , you old dog! If you ar e brave , the n come over  here!" Do Khyentse was a very impressive master. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He wa s like a samurai, with his long hair, his rakish clothes , an d his passion for  riding beautiful horses. As Patrul Rinpoche continued doing prostrations and bega n to approach closer, Do Khyentse , cursing him all th e time , started to hurl pebbles at him, and gradually larger rocks an d stones. Whe n he finally cam e withi n reach, Do Khyentse started punching him an d knocked him out altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whe n Patrul Rinpoche cam e to, he wa s in an entirely different stat e of consciousness . Th e mandalas he ha d been try -</p>
<p class="calibre2">ing so har d to visualiz e spontaneously manifested in fron t of him . Each of Do Khyentse's curse s an d insults ha d destroyed th e last remnants of Patrul Rinpoche's conceptual mind, an d each ston e tha t hit him opene d up th e energ y centers and subtle channels in his body. For  tw o marvelous weeks th e visions of the mandalas did not leave him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am going to attempt now to give some sense of wha t th e View is like an d ho w it feels whe n th e Rigpa is directly revealed, even though all words and conceptua terms fail, really, to describe it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dudjom Rinpoche says: "That moment is like taking a hood off your  head . What boundless spaciousness an d relief! </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the supreme seeing: seeing what was not seen before. " </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you "se e wha t wa s not seen before, "  everything opens , expands, an d becomes crisp, clear, brimming with life, vivid with wonde r  an d freshness. It is as if th e roof of your  min d were flying off, or a flock of birds suddenly took off from a 162 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">dark nest. All limitations dissolve and fall away, as if, the Tibetans say, a seal were broken open. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine you were living in a house on the top of a mountain, which was itself at the top of the whole world. Suddenly the entire structure of the house, which limited your view, just falls away and you can see all around you, both outside and inside. But there is not any "thing" to see; what happens has no ordinary reference whatsoever; it is total, complete, unprecedented, perfect seeing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dudjom Rinpoche says: 'Your deadliest enemies, the ones who have kept you tied to samsara through countless lives from beginningless time up until the present, are the grasping and the grasped." When the master introduces and you recognize, "These two are burned away completely like feathers in a flame, leaving no trace." Both grasping and grasped, what is grasped and the grasper, are freed completely from their very basis. The roots of ignorance and suffering are severed utterly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And all things appear like a reflection in a mirror, transparent, shimmering, illusory, and dream-like. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you naturally arrive at this state of meditation, inspired by the View, you can remain there for a long time without any distraction or special effort. Then there is nothing called "meditation" to protect or sustain, for you are in the natural flow of the wisdom of Rigpa. And you realize, when you are in it, that is how it has always been, and is. When the wisdom of Rigpa shines, not one shadow of doubt can remain, and a deep, complete understanding arises, effortlessly and directly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All the images I have given and the metaphors I have tried to use you will discover to be fused in one all-comprehensive experience of truth. Devotion is in this state, and compassion is in this state, and all the wisdoms, and bliss, clarity, and absence of thoughts, but not separate from one another, all integrated and linked inextricably with each other in one taste. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This moment is the moment of awakening. A profound sense of humor wells up from within, and you smile in amusement at how inadequate all your former concepts and ideas about the nature of mind were. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What springs from this is a growing sense of tremendous and unshakable certainty and conviction that "this is it": There is nothing further to seek, nothing more that could possibly be hoped for. This certainty of the View is what has to be deepened through glimpse after glimpse of the nature of mind, and stabilized through the continuous discipline of meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE INNERMOST ESSENCE 163 </p>
<p class="calibre2">MEDITATION </p>
<p class="calibre2">What, then, is meditation in Dzogchen? It is simply resting, undistracted, in the View, once it has been introduced. Dudjom Rinpoche describes it: "Meditation consists of being attentive to such a state of Rigpa, free from all mental constructions, whilst remaining fully relaxed, without any distraction or grasping. For it is said that 'Meditation is not striving, but naturally becoming assimilated into it.'" </p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole point of Dzogchen meditation practice is to strengthen and stabilize Rigpa, and allow it to grow to full maturity. The ordinary, habitual mind with its projections is extremely powerful. It keeps returning, and takes hold of us easily when we are inattentive or distracted. As Dudjom Rinpoche used to say, "At present our Rigpa is like a little baby, stranded on the battlefield of strong arising thoughts." I like to say we have to begin by babysitting our Rigpa, in the secure environment of meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If meditation is simply to continue the flow of Rigpa after the introduction, how do we know when it is Rigpa and when it is not? I asked Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche this question, and he replied with his characteristic simplicity: "If you are in an unaltered state, it is Rigpa." If we are not contriving or manipulating the mind in any way, but simply resting in an unaltered state of pure and pristine awareness, then that is Rigpa. If there is any contriving on our part or any kind of manipulating or grasping, it is not. Rigpa is a state in which there is no longer any doubt; there is not really a mind to doubt: You see direcdy. If you are in this state, a complete, natural certainty and confidence surge up with the Rigpa itself, and that is how you know.6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The tradition of Dzogchen is one of extreme precision, since the deeper you go, the subder the deceptions that can arise, and what is at stake is the knowledge of absolute reality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after the introduction, the masters clarify in detail the states that are not Dzogchen meditation and must not be confused with it. In one of these states you drift into a no-man's land of the mind, where there are no thoughts or memories; it is a dark, dull, indifferent state, where you are plunged into the ground of the ordinary mind. In a second state, there is some stillness and slight clarity, but the state of stillness is a stagnant one, still buried in the ordinary mind. In a third you experience an absence of thoughts, but are "spaced out" in a vacant state of wonder. In a fourth your mind wanders away, 164 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">hankering after thoughts and projections. None of these is the true state of meditation, and the practitioner has to watch out skillfully to avoid being deluded in these ways. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The essence of meditation practice in Dzogchen is encapsulated by these four points: </p>
<p class="calibre2">• When one past thought has ceased and a future thought has not yet risen, in that gap, in between, isn't there a consciousness of the present moment; fresh, virgin, unaltered by even a hair's breadth of concept, a luminous, naked awareness? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that is what Rigpa is! </p>
<p class="calibre2">• Yet it doesn't stay in that state forever, because another thought suddenly arises, doesn't it? </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the self-radiance of that Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">• However, if you do not recognize this thought for what it really is, the very instant it arises, then it will turn into just another ordinary thought, as before. This is called the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"chain of delusion," and is the root of samsara. </p>
<p class="calibre2">• If you are able to recognize the true nature of the thought as soon as it arises, and leave it alone without any follow-up, then whatever thoughts arise all automatically dissolve back into the vast expanse of Rigpa and are liberated. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Clearly it takes a lifetime of practice to understand and realize the full richness and majesty of these four profound yet simple points, and here I can only give you a taste of the vastness of what is meditation in Dzogchen. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps the most important point is that Dzogchen meditation comes to be a continual flow of Rigpa, like a river constantly moving day and night without any interruption. This, of course, is an ideal state, for this undistracted resting in the View, once it has been introduced and recognized, is the reward of years of sustained practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dzogchen meditation is subtly powerful in dealing with the arisings of the mind, and has a unique perspective on them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All the risings are seen in their true nature, not as separate from Rigpa, and not as antagonistic to it, but actually as none other—and this is very important—than its "self-radiance," the manifestation of its very energy. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Say you find yourself in a deep state of stillness; often it does not last very long and a thought or a movement always arises, like a wave in the ocean. Don't rq'ect the movement or particularly embrace the stillness, but continue the flow of THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 6 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">your pure presence. The pervasive, peaceful state of your meditation is the Rigpa itself, and all risings are none other than this Rigpa's self-radiance. This is the heart and the basis of Dzogchen practice. One way to imagine this is as if you were riding on the sun's rays back to the sun: You trace the risings back, at once, to their very root, the ground of Rigpa. As you embody the steadfast stability of the View, you are no longer deceived and distracted by whatever rises, and so cannot fall prey to delusion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course there are rough as well as gentle waves in the ocean; strong emotions come, like anger, desire, jealousy. The real practitioner recognizes them not as a disturbance or obstacle, but as a great opportunity. The fact that you react to arisings such as these with habitual tendencies of attachment and aversion is a sign not only that you are distracted, but also that you do not have the recognition and have lost the ground of Rigpa. To react to emotions in this way empowers them and binds us even tighter in the chains of delusion. The great secret of Dzogchen is to see right through them as soon as they arise, to what they really are: the vivid and electric manifestation of the energy of Rigpa itself. As you gradually learn to do this, even the most turbulent emotions fail to seize hold of you and dissolve, as wild waves rise and rear and sink back into the calm of the ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The practitioner discovers—and this is a revolutionary insight, whose subtlety and power cannot be overestimated— </p>
<p class="calibre2">that not only do violent emotions not necessarily sweep you away and drag you back into the whirlpools of your own neuroses, they can actually be used to deepen, embolden, invigorate, and strengthen the Rigpa. The tempestuous energy becomes raw food of the awakened energy of Rigpa. The stronger and more flaming the emotion, the more Rigpa is strengthened. I feel that this unique method of Dzogchen has extraordinary power to free even the most inveterate, deeply rooted emotional and psychological problems. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Let me introduce you now, as simply as I can, to an explanation of how exactly this process works. This will be invaluable later on, when we come to look at what happens at the moment of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Dzogchen the fundamental, inherent nature of everything is called the "Ground Luminosity" or the "Mother Luminosity." This pervades our whole experience, and is therefore 166 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">the inherent nature of the thoughts and emotions that arise in our minds as well, although we do not recognize it. When the master introduces us to the true nature of mind, to the state of Rigpa, it is as if he or she gives us a master key. In Dzogchen we call this key, which is going to open to us the door to total knowledge, the "Path Luminosity" or "Child Luminosity." The Ground Luminosity and the Path Luminosity are fundamentally the same, of course, and it is only for the purposes of explanation and practice that they are categorized in this way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But once we have the key of the Path Luminosity through the introduction of the master, we can use it at will to open the door to the innate nature of reality. This opening of the door in Dzogchen practice is called the "meeting of the Ground and Path Luminosities" or the "meeting of Mother and Child Luminosities." Another way to say this is that as soon as a thought or emotion arises, the Path Luminosity—the Rigpa—recognizes it immediately for what it is, recognizes its inherent nature, the Ground Luminosity. In that moment of recognition, the two luminosities merge and thoughts and emotions are liberated in their very ground. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is essential to perfect this practice of the merging of the two luminosities and the self-liberation of risings in life, because what happens at the moment of death, for everyone, is this: The Ground Luminosity dawns in vast splendor, and with it brings an opportunity for total liberation—if, and only if, you have learned how to recognize it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be clear now, perhaps, that this merging of the luminosities and self-liberation of thoughts and emotions is meditation at its very deepest level. In fact, a term such as </p>
<p class="calibre2">"meditation" is not really appropriate for Dzogchen practice, as ultimately it implies meditating "on" something, whereas in Dzogchen all is only and forever Rigpa. So there is no question of a meditation separate from simply abiding by the pure presence of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The only word that could possibly describe this is "non-meditation." In this state, the masters say, even if you look for delusion, there is none left. Even if you looked for ordinary pebbles on an island of gold and jewels, you wouldn't have a chance of finding any. When the View is constant, and the flow of Rigpa unfailing, and the merging of the two luminosities continuous and spontaneous, all possible delusion is liberated at its very root, and your entire perception arises, without a break, as Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The masters stress that to stabilize the View in meditation, THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 6 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">it is essential, first of all, to accomplish this practice in a <i class="calibre3"> special</i> <i class="calibre3">environment</i> of retreat, where all the favorable conditions are present; amidst the distractions and busyness of the world, however much you meditate, true experience will not be born in your mind. Second, though there is no difference in Dzogchen between meditation and everyday life, until you have found true stability through doing the practice in <i class="calibre3"> proper</i> <i class="calibre3">sessions, </i> you will not be able to integrate the wisdom of meditation into the experience of daily life. Third, even when you practice, you might be able to abide by the continual flow of Rigpa with the confidence of the View; but if you are unable to continue that flow <i class="calibre3"> at all times and in all situations, </i> mixing your practice with everyday life, it will not serve as a remedy when unfavorable circumstances arise, and you will be led astray into delusion by thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a delightful story about a Dzogchen yogin who lived unostentatiously, surrounded, however, by a large following of disciples. A certain monk, who had an exaggerated opinion of his own learning and scholarship, was jealous of the yogin, whom he knew not to be very well read at all. He thought: "How does he, just an ordinary person, dare to teach? How dare he pretend to be a master? I will go and test his knowledge, show it up for the sham it is and humiliate him in front of his disciples, so that they will leave him and follow me." </p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, then, he visited the yogin and said scornfully: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"You Dzogchen bunch, is meditate <i class="calibre3"> all</i> you ever do?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">The yogin's reply took him completely by surprise: "What is there to meditate on?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">'You don't even meditate, then," the scholar brayed triumphantly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"But when am I <i class="calibre3"> ever</i> distracted?" said the yogin. </p>
<p class="calibre2">ACTION </p>
<p class="calibre2">As abiding by the flow of Rigpa becomes a reality, it begins to permeate the practitioner's everyday life and action, and breeds a deep stability and confidence. Dudjom Rinpoche says: <i class="calibre3">Action is being truly observant of your own thoughts, good or bad,</i> <i class="calibre3">looking into the true nature of whatever thoughts may arise, neither tracing the past nor inviting the future, neither allowing any</i> <i class="calibre3">clinging to experiences of joy, nor being overcome by sad situations. In so doing, you try to reach and remain in the state of</i> 168 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">great equilibrium, where all good and bad, peace and distress, are</i> <i class="calibre3">devoid of true identity. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Realizing the View subtly but completely transforms your vision of everything. More and more, I have come to realize how thoughts and concepts are all that block us from always being, quite simply, in the absolute. Now I see clearly why the masters so often say: "Try hard not to create too much hope and fear," for they only engender more mental gossip. When the View is there, thoughts are seen for what they truly are: fleeting and transparent, and only relative. You see through everything directly, as if you had X-ray eyes. You do not cling to thoughts and emotions or reject them, but welcome them all within the vast embrace of Rigpa. What you took so seriously before—ambitions, plans, expectations, doubts, and passions—no longer have any deep and anxious hold on you, for the View has helped you to see the futility and pointlessness of them all, and born in you a spirit of true renunciation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remaining in the clarity and confidence of Rigpa allows all your thoughts and emotions to liberate naturally and effortlessly within its vast expanse, like writing in water or painting in the sky. If you truly perfect this practice, karma has no chance at all to be accumulated; and in this state of aimless, carefree abandon, what Dudjom Rinpoche calls "uninhibited, naked ease," the karmic law of cause and effect can no longer bind you in any way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't assume, whatever you do, that this is, or could possibly be, easy. It is extremely hard to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, even for a moment, let alone to self-liberate a single thought or emotion as it rises. We often assume that simply because we understand something intellectually, or think we do, we have actually realized it. This is a great delusion. It requires the maturity that only years of listening, contemplation, reflection, meditation, and sustained practice can ripen. And it cannot be said too often that the practice of Dzogchen always requires the guidance and instruction of a qualified master. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise there is a great danger, called in the tradition </p>
<p class="calibre2">"losing the Action in the View." A teaching as high and powerful as Dzogchen entails an extreme risk. Deluding yourself that you are liberating thoughts and emotions, when in fact you are nowhere near being able to do so, and thinking that you are acting with the spontaneity of a true Dzogchen yogin, all you are doing is simply accumulating vast amounts of neg-THE INNERMOST ESSENCE 169 </p>
<p class="calibre2">ative karma. As Padmasambhava says, and this is the attitude we all should have: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Though my View is as spacious as the sky,</i> <i class="calibre3">My actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of</i> <i class="calibre3">flour: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Masters of the Dzogchen tradition have stressed again and again that without being thoroughly and deeply acquainted with the "essence and method of self-liberation" through long practice, meditation "only furthers the path of delusion." This may seem harsh, but it is the case, because only constant self-liberation of thoughts can really end the reign of delusion and really protect you from being plunged again into suffering and neurosis. Without the method of self-liberation, you will not be able to withstand misfortunes and evil circumstances when they arise, and even if you meditate you will find that still emotions like anger and desire run as rampant as ever. The danger of other kinds of meditation that do not have this method is that they become like "the meditation of the gods," </p>
<p class="calibre2">straying all too easily into sumptuous self-absorption or passive trance or vacancy of one kind or another, none of which attack and dissolve delusion at its root. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The great Dzogchen master Vimalamitra spoke in the most precise way of the degrees of increasing naturalness in this liberation: When you first master this practice, liberation happens simultaneously with the rising, like recognizing an old friend in a crowd. Perfecting and deepening the practice, liberation happens simultaneously with the arising of thought and emotion, like a snake uncoiling and unwinding its own knots. And in the final state of mastery, liberation is like a thief entering an empty house; whatever arises neither harms nor benefits a true Dzogchen yogin. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even in the greatest yogin, sorrow and joy still arise just as before. The difference between an ordinary person and the yogin is how they view their emotions and react to them. An ordinary person will instinctively accept or reject them, and so arouse the attachment or aversion that will result in the accumulation of negative karma. A yogin, however, perceives everything that rises in its natural, pristine state, without allowing grasping to enter his or her perception. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche describes a yogin wandering through a garden. He is completely awake to the splendor and beauty of the flowers, and relishes their colors, shapes, and 170 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">scents. But there is no trace of clinging nor any "after-thought" </p>
<p class="calibre2">in his mind. As Dudjom Rinpoche says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Whatever perceptions arise, you should be like a little child going</i> <i class="calibre3">into a beautifully decorated temple-, he looks, but grasping does not</i> <i class="calibre3">enter into his perception at all. So you leave everything fresh, natural, vivid, and unspoiled. When you leave each thing in its own</i> <i class="calibre3">state, then its shape doesn't change, its color doesn't fade, and its</i> <i class="calibre3">glow does not disappear. Whatever appears is unstained by any</i> <i class="calibre3">grasping, so then all that you perceive arises as the naked wisdom</i> <i class="calibre3">of Rigpa, which is the indivisibility of luminosity and emptiness. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The confidence, the contentment, the spacious serenity, the strength, the profound humor, and the certainty that arise from directly realizing the View of Rigpa is the greatest treasure of life, the ultimate happiness, which, once attained, nothing can destroy, not even death. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Once you have the View, although the delusory perceptions of</i> <i class="calibre3">samsara may arise in your mind, you will be like the sky; when a</i> <i class="calibre3">rainbow appears in front of it, its not particularly flattered, and</i> <i class="calibre3">when the clouds appear, its not particularly disappointed either. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">There is a deep sense of contentment. You chuckle from inside as</i> <i class="calibre3">you see the facade of samsara and nirvana; the View will keep</i> <i class="calibre3">you constantly amused, with a little inner smile bubbling away all</i> <i class="calibre3">the time. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Dudjom Rinpoche says: "Having purified the great delusion, the heart's darkness, the radiant light of the unobscured sun continuously rises." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone who takes to heart the instruction of this book about Dzogchen and its message about dying, will, I hope, be inspired to seek, find, and follow a qualified master, and undertake to commit him- or herself to a complete training. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The heart of the Dzogchen training is two practices,  <i class="calibre3"> Trekcho</i> and <i class="calibre3"> Togal, </i> which are indispensable for a deep understanding of what happens during the bardos. I can only give here the briefest of introductions to them. The complete explanation is only given from a master to disciple, when the disciple has made a wholehearted commitment to the teachings, and reached a certain stage of development. What I have explained THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 7 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">in this chapter, "The Innermost Essence," is the heart of the practice of Trekcho. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Trekcho means cutting through delusion with fierce, direct thoroughness. Essentially delusion is cut through with the irre-sistible force of the View of Rigpa, like a knife cleaving through butter or a karate expert demolishing a pile of bricks. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole fantastical edifice of delusion collapses, as if you were blasting its keystone away. Delusion is cut through, and the primordial purity and natural simplicity of the nature of mind is laid bare. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Only when the master has determined that you have a thorough grounding in the practice of Trekcho will he or she introduce you to the advanced practice of Togal. Togal practitioners work directly with the Clear Light that dwells inherently, "spontaneously present," within all phenomena, using specific and exceptionally powerful exercises to reveal it within himself or herself. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Togal has a quality of instantaneousness, of immediate realization. Instead of traveling over a range of mountains to reach a distant peak, the Togal approach would be to leap there in one bound. The effect of Togal is to enable persons to actual-ize all the different aspects of enlightenment within themselves in one lifetime.7 Therefore it is regarded as the extraordinary, unique method of Dzogchen; whereas Trekcho is its wisdom, Togal is its skillful means. It requires enormous discipline and is generally practiced in a retreat environment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet it cannot be stressed too often that the path of Dzogchen can only be followed under the direct guidance of a qualified master. As the Dalai Lama says: "One fact that you must bear in mind is that the practices of Dzogchen, such as Trekcho and Togal, can only be achieved through the guidance of an experienced master, and through receiving the inspiration and blessing from a living person who has that realization."8 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE RAINBOW BODY </p>
<p class="calibre2">Through these advanced practices of Dzogchen, accomplished practitioners can bring their lives to an extraordinary and triumphant end. As they die, they enable their body to be reabsorbed back into the light essence of the elements that created it, and consequently their material body dissolves into light and then disappears completely. This process is known as the "rainbow body" or "body of light," because the dissolution 172 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">is often accompanied by spontaneous manifestations of light and rainbows. The ancient Tantras of Dzogchen, and the writings of the great masters, distinguish different categories of this amazing, otherworldly phenomenon, for at one time, if at least not normal, it was reasonably frequent. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Usually a person who knows he or she is about to attain the rainbow body will ask to be left alone and undisturbed in a room or a tent for seven days. On the eighth day only the hair and nails, the impurities of the body, are found. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This may be very difficult for us now to believe, but the factual history of the Dzogchen lineage is full of examples of individuals who attained the rainbow body, and as Dudjom Rinpoche often used to point out, this is not just ancient history. Of the many examples, I would like to choose one of the most recent, one with which I have a personal connection. In 1952 there was a famous instance of the rainbow body in the east of Tibet, witnessed by many people. The man who attained it, Sonam Namgyal, was the father of my tutor and the brother of Lama Tseten, whose death I described at the beginning of this book. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He was a very simple, humble person who made his way as an itinerant stone carver, carving mantras and sacred texts. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some say he had been a hunter in his youth, and had received teaching from a great master. No one really knew he was a practitioner; he was truly what is called "a hidden yogin." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Some time before his death, he would be seen going up into the mountains and just sit, silhouetted against the skyline, gazing up into space. He composed his own songs and chants and sang them instead of the traditional ones. No one had any idea what he was doing. He then fell ill, or seemed to, but he became, strangely, increasingly happy. When the illness got worse, his family called in masters and doctors. His son told him he should remember all the teachings he had heard, and he smiled and said, "I've forgotten them all and anyway, there's nothing to remember. Everything is illusion, but I am confident that all is well." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just before his death at seventy-nine, he said: "All I ask is that when I die, don't move my body for a week." When he died his family wrapped his body and invited Lamas and monks to come and practice for him. They placed the body in a small room in the house, and they could not help noticing that although he had been a tall person, they had no trouble getting it in, as if he were becoming smaller. At the same time, an extraordinary display of rainbow-colored light was THE INNERMOST ESSENCE  1 7 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">seen all around the house. When they looked into the room on the sixth day, they saw that the body was getting smaller and smaller. On the eighth day after his death, the morning for which the funeral had been arranged, the undertakers arrived to collect his body. When they undid its coverings, they found nothing inside but his nails and hair. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My master Jamyang Khyentse asked for these to be brought to him, and verified that this was a case of the rainbow body. </p>

<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Heart Advice </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">on Helping the Dying </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">IN A HOSPICE I KNOW, Emily, a woman in her late sixties, was dying of breast cancer. Her daughter would visit her every day and there seemed to be a happy relationship between the two. But when her daughter had left, Emily would nearly always sit alone and cry. After a while it became clear that the reason for this was that her daughter had refused completely to accept the inevitability of her death, but spent her whole time encouraging her mother to "think positively," hoping that by this her cancer would be cured. All that happened was that Emily had to keep her thoughts, deep fears, panic, and grief to herself, with no one to share them with, no one to help her explore them, no one to help her understand her life, and no one to help her find a healing meaning in her death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The most essential thing in life is to establish an unafraid, heartfelt communication with others, and it is never more important than with a dying person, as Emily showed me. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Often the dying person feels reserved and insecure, and is not sure of your intentions when you first visit. So don't feel anything extraordinary is supposed to happen, just be natural and relaxed, be yourself. Often dying people don't say what they want or mean, and the people close to them don't know what to say or do. It's hard to find out what they might be trying to say, or even what they might be hiding. Sometimes not even they know. So the first essential thing is to relax any tension in the atmosphere in whatever way comes most easily and naturally. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Once trust and confidence have been established, the atmosphere becomes relaxed and this will allow the dying person to bring up the things he or she really wants to talk about. </p>
<p class="calibre2">177 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">178 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Encourage the person warmly to feel as free as possible to express thoughts, fears, and emotions about dying and death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This honest and unshrinking baring of emotion is central to any possible transformation—of coming to terms with life or dying a good death—and you must allow the person complete freedom, giving your full permission to say whatever he or she wants. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When the dying person is finally communicating his or her most private feelings, do not interrupt, deny, or diminish what the person is saying. The terminally ill or dying are in the most vulnerable situation of their lives, and you will need all your skill and resources of sensitivity, and warmth, and loving compassion to enable them to reveal themselves. Learn to listen, and learn to receive in silence: an open, calm silence that makes the other person feel accepted. Be as relaxed as you can, be at ease; sit there with your dying friend or relative as if you had nothing more important or enjoyable to do. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have found that, as in all grave situations of life, two things are most useful: a common-sense approach and a sense of humor. Humor has a marvelous way of lightening the atmosphere, helping to put the process of dying in its true and universal perspective, and breaking the over-seriousness and intensity of the situation. Use humor, then, as skillfully and as gendy as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have found also, from my own experience, that it is essential not to take anything too personally. When you least expect it, dying people can make you the target of all their anger and blame. As Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross says, anger and blame can "be displaced in all directions, and projected onto the environment at times almost at random."1 Do not imagine that this rage is really aimed at you; realizing what fear and grief it springs from will stop you from reacting to it in ways that might damage your relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes you may be tempted to preach to the dying, or to give them your own spiritual formula. Avoid this tempta-tion absolutely, especially when you suspect that it is not what the dying person wants! No one wishes to be "rescued" </p>
<p class="calibre2">with someone else's beliefs. Remember your task is not to convert anyone to anything, but to help the person in front of you get in touch with his or her own strength, confidence, faith, and spirituality, whatever that might be. Of course, if the person is really open to spiritual matters, and really wants to know what you think about them, don't hold back either. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't expect too much from yourself, or expect your help HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING 179 </p>
<p class="calibre2">to produce miraculous results in the dying person or "save" </p>
<p class="calibre2">them. You will only be disappointed. People will die as they have lived, as themselves. For real communication to be established, you must make a determined effort to see the person in terms of his or her own life, character, background, and history, and to accept the person unreservedly. Also don't be distressed if your help seems to be having very little effect and the dying person does not respond. We cannot know the deeper effects of our care. </p>
<p class="calibre2">SHOWING UNCONDITIONAL LOVE </p>
<p class="calibre2">A dying person most needs to be shown as unconditional a love as possible, released from all expectations. Don't think you have to be an expert in any way. Be natural, be yourself, be a true friend, and the dying person will be reassured that you are really with them, communicating with them simply and as an equal, as one human being to another. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have said, "Show the dying person unconditional love," </p>
<p class="calibre2">but in some situations that is far from easy. We may have a long history of suffering with the person, we may feel guilty about what we have done to the person in the past, or anger and resentment at what the person has done to us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So let me suggest two very simple ways in which you can release the love within you toward the dying person. I and my students who work with the dying have found both these ways to be powerful. First, look at the dying person in front of you and think of that person as just like you, with the same needs, the same fundamental desire to be happy and avoid suffering, the same loneliness, the same fear of the unknown, the same secret areas of sadness, the same half-acknowledged feelings of helplessness. You will find that if you really do this, your heart will open toward the person and love will be present between you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The second way, and I have found this even more powerful, is to put yourself directly and unflinchingly in the dying person's place. Imagine that you are on that bed before you, facing your death. Imagine that you are there in pain and alone. Then really ask yourself: What would you most need? </p>
<p class="calibre2">What would you most like? What would you really wish from the friend in front of you? </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you do these two practices, I think you would find that what the dying person wants is what <i class="calibre3"> you</i> would most want: to be really loved and accepted. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">180 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have often seen also that people who are very sick long to be touched, long to be treated as living people and not diseases. A great deal of consolation can be given to the very ill simply by touching their hands, looking into their eyes, gently massaging them or holding them in your arms, or breathing in the same rhythm gently with them. The body has its own language of love; use it fearlessly, and you will find you bring to the dying comfort and consolation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Often we forget that the dying are losing their whole world: their house, their job, their relationships, their body, and their mind—they're losing everything. All the losses we could possibly experience in life are joined together in one overwhelming loss when we die, so how could anyone dying not be sometimes sad, sometimes panicked, sometimes angry? Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross suggests five stages in the process of coming to terms with dying: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Of course not everyone will go through all these stages, or necessarily in this order; and for some people the road to acceptance may be an extremely long and thorny one; others may not reach acceptance at all. Ours is a culture that does not give people very much true perspective on their thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and many people facing death and its final challenge find themselves feeling cheated by their own ignorance, and terribly frustrated and angry, especially since no one seems to want to comprehend them and their most heartfelt needs. As Cicely Saunders, the great pioneer of the hospice movement in Britain, writes: "I once asked a man who knew he was dying what he needed above all in those who were caring for him. He said, 'For someone to look as if they are trying to understand me.' Indeed, it is impossible to understand fully another person, but I never forgot that he did not ask for success but only that someone should care enough to try."2 </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is essential that we care enough to try, and that we reassure the person that whatever he or she may be feeling, whatever his or her frustration and anger, it is normal. Dying will bring out many repressed emotions: sadness or numbness or guilt, or even jealousy of those who are still well. Help the person not to repress these emotions when they rise. Be with the person as the waves of pain and grief break; with acceptance, time, and patient understanding, the emotions slowly subside and return the dying person to that ground of serenity, calm, and sanity that is most deeply and truly theirs. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING<b class="calibre4"> 181 </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't try to be too wise; don't always try to search for something profound to say. You don't have to <i class="calibre3"> do</i> or say anything to make things better. Just be there as fully as you can. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And if you are feeling a lot of anxiety and fear, and don't know what to do, admit that openly to the dying person and ask his or her help. This honesty will bring you and the dying person closer together, and help in opening up a freer communication. Sometimes the dying know far better than we how they can be helped, and we need to know how to draw on their wisdom and let them give to us what they know. Cicely Saunders has asked us to remind ourselves that, in being with the dying, we are not the only givers. "Sooner or later all who work with dying people know they are receiving more than they are giving as they meet endurance, courage and often humor. We need to say so .. ."3 Acknowledging our recognition of their courage can often inspire the dying person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I find too that I have been helped by remembering one thing: that the person in front of me dying is always, somewhere, inherently good. Whatever rage or emotion arises, however momentarily shocking or horrifying these may be, focusing on that inner goodness will give you the control and perspective you need to be as helpful as possible. Just as when you quarrel with a good friend, you don't forget the best parts of that person, do the same with the dying person: Don't judge them by whatever emotions arise. This acceptance of yours will release the dying person to be as uninhibited as he or she needs to be. Treat the dying as if they were what they are sometimes capable of being: open, loving, and generous. </p>
<p class="calibre2">On a deeper, spiritual level, I find it extremely helpful always to remember the dying person has the true buddha nature, whether he or she realizes it or not, and the potential for complete enlightenment. As the dying come closer to death, this possibility is in many ways even greater. So they deserve even more care and respect. </p>
<p class="calibre2">TELLING THE TRUTH<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">People often ask me: "Should people be told they are dying?" And I always reply: "Yes, as quietly, as kindly, as sensitively, and as skillfully as possible." From my years of visiting ill and dying patients, I agree with Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross, who has observed that: "Most, if not all, of the patients know anyway. They sense it by the changed attention, by the new and different approach that people take to them, by the lowering 182 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">of voices or avoidance of sounds, by the tearful face of a relative or ominous, unsmiling member of the family who cannot hide his true feelings."4 </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have often found that people instinctively know they are dying, but count on others—their doctor or loved ones—to confirm it. If they don't, the dying person may think it is because family members cannot cope with the news. And then the dying person won't bring up the subject either. This lack of honesty will make him or her feel only more isolated and more anxious. I believe it is essential to tell the dying person the truth; he or she at least deserves that much. If the dying are not told the truth, how can they prepare themselves for death? How can they carry the relationships of their lives to a true conclusion? How can they take care of the many practical issues they must resolve? How can they help those who are left when they are gone to survive? </p>
<p class="calibre2">From my point of view as a spiritual practitioner, I believe dying to be a great opportunity for people to come to terms with their whole lives; and I have seen many, many individuals take this opportunity, in the most inspiring way, to change themselves and come closer to their own deepest truth. So by kindly and sensitively telling people at the earliest opportunity that they are dying, we are really giving them the chance to prepare, and to find their own powers of strength, and the meaning of their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Let me tell you a story I was told by Sister Brigid, a Catholic nurse working in an Irish hospice. Mr. Murphy was in his sixties, and he and his wife were told by their doctor that he did not have long to live. The following day Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Murphy visited her husband at the hospice, and they talked and wept all day long. Sister Brigid watched as the old couple talked and frequently broke down into tears, and when this had gone on for three days, she wondered if she should inter-vene. Yet the next day the Murphys seemed suddenly very relaxed and peaceful, holding hands and showing each other great tenderness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sister Brigid stopped Mrs. Murphy in the corridor and asked her what had taken place between them to have made such a great change on their behavior. Mrs. Murphy told her that when they found out her husband was dying, they looked back over their years together, and many memories came back to them. They had been married almost forty years, and naturally they felt enormous sorrow, thinking and talking about all the things they would never be able to do HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING  1 8 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">together again. Mr. Murphy had then made out his will, and written final messages to his grown-up children. All of this was terribly sad, because it was so hard to let go, but they carried on, as Mr. Murphy wanted to end his life well. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sister Brigid told me that for the next three weeks Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Murphy lived, the couple radiated peace and a simple, wonderful feeling of love. Even after her husband died, Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Murphy continued to visit patients at the hospice, where she was an inspiration to everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This story shows to me the importance of telling people early that they are going to die, and also the great advantage of facing squarely the pain of loss. The Murphys knew that they were going to lose many things, but by facing those losses and grieving together, they found what they could not lose, the deep love between them that would remain after Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Murphy's death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">FEARS ABOUT DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am sure one of the things that helped Mrs. Murphy help her husband was that she faced within herself her own fears of dying. You cannot help the dying until you have acknowledged how their fear of dying disturbs you and brings up your most uncomfortable fears. Working with the dying is like facing a polished and fierce mirror of your own reality. You see in it the stark face of your own panic and of your terror of pain. If you don't look at and accept that face of panic and fear in yourself, how will you be able to bear it in the person in front of you? When you come to try and help the dying, you will need to examine your every reaction, since your reactions will be reflected in those of the person dying and will contribute a great deal to their help or detriment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at your fears honestly will also help you in your own journey to maturity. Sometimes I think there could be no more effective way of speeding up our growth as human beings than working with the dying. Caring for the dying is itself a deep contemplation and reflection on your own death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a way to face and work with it. When you work with the dying, you can come to a kind of resolution, a clear understanding of what is the most important focus of life. To learn really to help those who are dying is to begin to become fearless and responsible about our own dying, and to find in ourselves the beginnings of an unbounded compassion that we may never have suspected. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">184 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Being aware of your own fears about dying will help you immeasurably to be aware of the fears of the dying person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just imagine deeply what those might be: fear of increasing, uncontrolled pain, fear of suffering, fear of indignity, fear of dependence, fear that the lives we have led have been meaningless, fear of separation from all we love, fear of losing control, fear of losing respect; perhaps our greatest fear of all is fear of fear itself, which grows more and more powerful the more we evade it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Usually when you feel fear, you feel isolated and alone, and without company. But when somebody keeps company with you and talks of his or her own fears, then you realize fear is universal and the edge, the personal pain, is taken off it. Your fears are brought back to the human and universal context. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then you are able to understand, be more compassionate, and deal with your own fears in a much more positive and inspiring way. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As you grow to confront and accept your own fears, you will become increasingly sensitive to those of the person before you, and you will find you develop the intelligence and insight to help that person to bring his or her fears out into the open, deal with them, and begin skillfully to dispel them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For facing your fears, you will find, will not only make you more compassionate and braver and clearer; it will also make you more skillful, and that skillfulness will open to you all kinds of ways of enabling the dying to understand and face themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the fears that we can most easily dispel is the anxiety we all have about unmitigated pain in the process of dying. I would like to think that everyone in the world could know that this is now unnecessary. Physical suffering should be kept to a minimum; there is enough suffering in death anyway. A study at St. Christopher's Hospice in London, which I know well and where my students have died, has shown that given the right care, 98 percent of patients can have a peaceful death. The hospice movement has developed a variety of ways of managing pain by using various combinations of drugs, and not simply narcotics. The Buddhist masters speak of the need to die consciously with as lucid, unblurred, and serene a mental mastery as possible. Keeping pain under control without clouding the dying person's consciousness is the first prerequisite for this, and now it can be done: Everyone should be entitled to that simple help at this most demanding moment of passage. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING 185 </p>
<p class="calibre2">UNFINISHED BUSINESS<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another anxiety of the dying is often that of leaving unfinished business. The masters tell us that we should die peacefully, "without grasping, yearning, and attachment." This cannot fully happen if the unfinished business of a lifetime, as far as possible, is not cleared. Sometimes you will find that people hold onto life and are afraid to let go and die, because they have not come to terms with what they have been and done. And when a person dies harboring guilt or bad feelings toward others, those who survive him suffer even more deeply in their grief. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes people ask me: "Isn't it too late to heal the pain of the past? Hasn't there been too much suffering between me and my dying friend or relative for healing to be possible?" It is my belief, and has been my experience, that it is never too late; even after enormous pain and abuse, people can find a way to forgive each other. The moment of death has a grandeur, solemnity, and finality that can make people reexamine all their attitudes, and be more open and ready to forgive, when before they could not bear to. Even at the very end of a life, the mistakes of a life can be undone. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a method for helping to complete unfinished business that I and my students who work with the dying find very helpful. It was formulated from the Buddhist practice of equalizing and exchanging the self with others, and from the Gestalt technique, by Christine Longaker, one of my earliest students, who came to the field of death and dying after the death of her husband from leukemia.5 Usually unfinished business is the result of blocked communication; when we have been wounded, we often become very defensive, always argu-ing from a position of being in the right and blindly refusing to see the other person's point of view. This is not only unhelpful, it freezes any possibility of real exchange. So when you do this exercise, begin it with the strong motivation that you are bringing up all your negative thoughts and feelings to try and understand them, to work with them and resolve them, and finally now to let go of them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then visualize in front of you the person with whom you have the problem. See this person in your mind's eye, exactly as he or she has always looked to you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Consider now that a real change takes place, so the person is far more open and receptive to listen to what you have to say, more willing than ever before to share honesdy, and 186 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">resolve the problem between you. Visualize vividly the person in this new state of openness. This will also help you feel more open toward him or her. Then really feel, deep in your heart, what it is you most need to say to the person. Tell him or her what the problem is, tell the person all your feelings, your difficulties, your hurt, your regret. Tell him or her what you haven't felt safe, or comfortable enough, to say before. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now take a piece of paper and write what you would say, all of it. Then, when you have finished, immediately begin to write what he or she might say in response to you. Don't stop to think about what the person used to say: Remember that now, as you have visualized, he or she has truly heard you and is more open. So just write, see what comes spontaneously; and allow the person, in your mind, to express completely his or her side of the problem as well. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Search yourself and see if there is anything else you need to say to the person—any other hurt feelings or regrets from the past that you have been holding back or have never aired. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, each time after you have stated your feelings, write a response by the other person, writing down just whatever comes into your mind. Continue this dialogue until you really feel there is nothing more you are holding back, and nothing more that needs to be said. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To see if you are truly ready to conclude the dialogue, ask yourself deeply if you are now able to let go of the past wholeheartedly, really able, satisfied by the insight and healing that this written dialogue has given you, to forgive this person, or to feel that he or she would forgive you. When you feel you have accomplished this, remember to express any last feelings of love or appreciation you may have been holding back, and say goodbye. Visualize the person turning away and leaving now; and even though you must let go of him or her, remember that you can keep his or her love, and the warm memories of the best aspects of your relationship, always in your heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To come to an even clearer reconciliation with the past, find a friend to whom you can read your written dialogue, or read it out loud by yourself at home. Once you have read this dialogue aloud, you will be surprised to notice a change in yourself, as though you have <i class="calibre3"> actually</i> communicated with the other person, and <i class="calibre3"> actually</i> cleared with them all the problems you have been having. Afterward you will find it far easier to let go, to speak directly with the other person about your difficulties. And when you have really let go, a subtle shift in the HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING  1 8 7 </p>

<p class="calibre2">A student of mine wh o work s in a hospic e told me of an elderly Scottish woman, Maggie, who m she visited after  her husband, close to death, had already fallen into a coma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Maggie felt inconsolably sad, for she had never spoken to her husban d abou t her  love for  him , nor  said goodbye, an d no w she felt it wa s too late.

She urged her  to spen d some tim e with her  husband, 188 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">telling him all she wanted to say. Maggie would not have thought of doing this, but she went ahead and spoke to her husband of all the good times they had shared, of how she would miss him, and of how much she loved him. At the end, once she had said her goodbyes, she told him, "It is hard for me to be without you, but I don't want to see you suffer any more, so it is all right for you to let go." Once she had finished, her husband let out a long sigh and peacefully died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only the one who is dying, but his or her whole family has to learn how to let go. Each member of the family may be at a different stage of acceptance, and this will have to be taken into account. One of the great achievements of the hospice movement is to recognize how important it is to help the whole family face their own grief and insecurity about the future. Some families resist letting their loved ones go, thinking that to do so is a betrayal, and a sign that they don't love them enough. Christine Longaker tells these families to imagine that they are in the place of the one who is dying. "Imagine you are standing on the deck of an ocean liner, about to set sail. You look back on the shore and see all your family and friends waving goodbye. You have no choice about leaving, and the ship is already moving away. How would you want the people you loved to be saying goodbye to you? </p>
<p class="calibre2">What would help you most on your journey?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even a simple exercise like this can help so much in enabling each member of the family in their own way to deal with the sadness of saying goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes people ask me, "What should I say to my child about the death of her relative?" I say to them to be sensitive but tell the truth. Don't let the child think that death is something strange or terrifying. Let her take part as far as possible in the life of the dying person, and answer honestly any questions the child might pose. A child's directness and innocence can actually bring a sweetness, lightness, even sometimes a humor into the pain of dying. Encourage the child to pray for the dying person, and so feel that he or she is really doing something to help. And after the death has taken place, make sure that you give the child special attention and affection. </p>
<p class="calibre2">TOWARD A<b class="calibre4"> </b>PEACEFUL DEATH<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I think back to Tibet and the deaths I witnessed there, I am struck by what a calm and harmonious environment many of them occurred in. This kind of environment, HEART ADVICE ON HELPING THE DYING 189 </p>
<p class="calibre2">alas, is often lacking in the West, but my experience over the last twenty years has shown that it can, with imagination, be created. I feel that wherever possible, people should die at home, because it is at home that the majority of people are likely to feel most comfortable. And the peaceful death that the Buddhist masters advise is easiest to obtain in familiar surroundings. But if someone has to die in hospital, there is a great deal that you the loved ones can do to make that death as easy and inspiring as possible. Bring in plants, flowers, pictures, photographs of loved ones, drawings by children and grandchildren, a cassette player with musical tapes, or, if possible, home-cooked meals. You might even get permission for children to visit or for loved ones to stay overnight. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If the dying person is a Buddhist or a member of another faith, friends could make a small shrine in his or her room, with inspiring pictures or images. I remember a student of mine, Reiner, who was dying in a private ward in a hospital in Munich. A shrine had been created for him with pictures of his masters on it. I was very moved by it, and realized how profoundly Reiner was being helped by the atmosphere it created. The Buddhist teachings tell us to make a shrine with offerings when a person is dying. Seeing Reiner's devotion and peace of mind made me understand just how empowering this can be, and how it can help inspire people to make their dying a sacred process. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When a person is very close to death, I suggest that you request that the hospital staff do not disturb him or her so often, and that they stop taking tests. I'm often asked what is my attitude toward death in intensive care units. I have to say that being in an intensive care unit will make a peaceful death very difficult, and hardly allow for spiritual practice at the moment of death. As the person is dying, there is no privacy: They are hooked up to monitors, and attempts to resuscitate them will be made when they stop breathing or their heart fails. There will be no chance of leaving the body undisturbed for a period of time after death, as the masters advise. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you can, you should arrange with the doctor to be told when there is no possibility of the person recovering, and then request to have them moved to a private room, if the dying person wishes it, with the monitors disconnected. Make sure that the staff knows and respects the dying person's wishes, especially if he or she does not wish to be resuscitated, and make sure that the staff knows too to leave the body undisturbed after death for as long as possible. In a modern hospital, 190 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">of course, it is not possible to leave the body alone for the three-day period that was customary in Tibet, but every support of silence and peace should be given to the dead to help them begin their journey after death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Try and make certain also that while the person is actually in the final stages of dying, all injections and all invasive procedures of any kind are discontinued. These can cause anger, irritation, and pain, and for the mind of the dying person to be as calm as possible in the moments before death is, as I will explain in detail later, absolutely crucial. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Most people die in a state of unconsciousness. One fact we have learned from the near-death experience is that comatose and dying patients may be much more aware of things around them than we realize. Many of the near-death experiencers reported out-of-the-body experiences, from which they were able to give surprisingly accurate detailed accounts of their surroundings and even, in some cases, of other rooms in the same hospital. This clearly shows the importance of talking positively and frequently to a dying person or to a person in a coma. Conscious, alert, and actively loving care for the dying person must go on until the last moments of his or her life, and as I will show, even beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the things I hope for from this book is that doctors all over the world will take <i class="calibre3"> extremely seriously</i> the need to allow the dying person to die in silence and serenity. I want to appeal to the goodwill of the medical profession, and hope to inspire it to find ways to make the very difficult transition of death as easy, painless, and peaceful as possible. Peaceful death is really an essential human right, more essential perhaps even than the right to vote or the right to justice; it is a right on which, all religious traditions tell us, a great deal depends for the well-being and spiritual future of the dying person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no greater gift of charity you can give than helping a person to die well. </p>
<p id="p212"  class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">TWELVE </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Compassion: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">CARING FOR THE DYING makes you poignantly </p>
<p class="calibre2">aware not only of their mortality but also of your own. So many veils and illusions separate us from the stark knowledge that we are dying; when we finally know we are dying, and all other sentient beings are dying with us, we start to have a burning, almost heartbreaking sense of the fragility and preciousness of each moment and each being, and from this can grow a deep, clear, limidess compassion for all beings. Sir Thomas More, I heard, wrote these words just before his beheading: "We are all in the same cart, going to execution; how can I hate anyone or wish anyone harm?" To feel the full force of your mortality, and to open your heart entirely to it, is to allow to grow in you that all-encompassing, fearless compassion that fuels the lives of all those who wish truly to be of help to others. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So everything that I have been saying up until now about caring for the dying could perhaps be summed up in two words: love and compassion. What is compassion? It is not simply a sense of sympathy or caring for the person suffering, not simply a warmth of heart toward the person before you, or a sharp clarity of recognition of their needs and pain, it is also a sustained and practical determination to do whatever is possible and necessary to help alleviate their suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Compassion is not true compassion unless it is active. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, is often represented in Tibetan iconography as having a thousand eyes that see the pain in all corners of the universe, and a thousand arms to reach out to all corners of the universe to extend his help. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE LOGIC OF COMPASSION </p>
<p class="calibre2">We all feel and know something of the benefits of compassion. But the particular strength of the Buddhist teaching is that it shows you clearly a "logic" of compassion. Once you have grasped it, this logic makes your practice of compassion at once more urgent and all-embracing, and more stable and grounded, because it is based on the clarity of a reasoning whose truth becomes ever more apparent as you pursue and test it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We may say, and even half-believe, that compassion is marvelous, but in practice our actions are deeply uncompassionate and bring us and others mostly frustration and distress, and not the happiness we are all seeking. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Isn't it absurd, then, that we all long for happiness, yet nearly all our actions and feelings lead us directly away from that happiness? Could there be any greater sign that our whole view of what real happiness is, and of how to attain it, is radically flawed? </p>
<p class="calibre2">What do we imagine will make us happy? A canny, self-seeking, resourceful selfishness, the selfish protection of ego, which can, as we all know, make us at moments extremely brutal. But in fact the complete reverse is true: Self-grasping and self-cherishing are seen, when you really look at them, to be the root of all harm to others, and also of all harm to ourselves.1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Every single negative thing we have ever thought or done has ultimately arisen from our grasping at a false self, and our cherishing of that false self, making it the dearest and most important element in our lives. All those negative thoughts, emotions, desires, and actions that are the cause of our negative karma are engendered by self-grasping and self-cherishing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They are the dark, powerful magnet that attracts to us, life after life, every obstacle, every misfortune, every anguish, every disaster, and so they are the root cause of all the sufferings of samsara. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When we have really grasped the law of karma in all its stark power and complex reverberations over many, many lifetimes, and seen just how our self-grasping and self-cherishing, life after life, have woven us repeatedly into a net of ignorance that seems only to be ensnaring us more and more tightly; when we have really understood the dangerous and doomed nature of the self-grasping mind's enterprise; when we have really pursued its operations into their most subtle hiding places; when we have really understood just how our whole COMPASSION: THE WISH-FULFILLING JEWEL  1 9 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">ordinary mind and actions are defined, narrowed, and darkened by it, how almost impossible it makes it for us to uncover the heart of unconditional love, and how it has blocked in us all sources of real love and real compassion, then there comes a moment when we understand, with extreme and poignant clarity, what Shantideva said: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">If all the harms </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Fears and sufferings in the world </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Arise from self-grasping, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">What need have I for such a great evil spirit? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">and a resolution is born in us to destroy that evil spirit, our greatest enemy. With that evil spirit dead, the cause of all our suffering will be removed, and our true nature, in all its spaciousness and dynamic generosity, will shine out. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You can have no greater ally in this war against your greatest enemy, your own self-grasping and self-cherishing, than the practice of compassion. It is compassion, dedicating ourselves to others, taking on their suffering instead of cherishing ourselves, that hand in hand with the wisdom that realizes egolessness destroys most effectively and most completely that ancient attachment to a false self that has been the cause of our endless wandering in samsara. That is why in our tradition we see compassion as the source and essence of enlightenment, and the heart of enlightened activity. As Shantideva says: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">What need is there to say more? </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The childish work for their own benefit, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The buddhas work for the benefit of others. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">just look at the difference between them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">If I do not exchange my happiness </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">For the suffering of others, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">I shall not attain the state of buddhahood</i> <i class="calibre3">And even in samsara I shall have no real joy2 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">To realize what I call the wisdom of compassion is to see with complete clarity its benefits, as well as the damage that its opposite has done to us. We need to make a very clear distinction between what is in our <i class="calibre3"> ego's self-interest</i> and what is in <i class="calibre3">our ultimate interest; </i> it is from mistaking one for the other that all our suffering comes. We go on stubbornly believing that 194 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">self-cherishing is the best protection in life, but in fact the opposite is true. Self-grasping creates self-cherishing, which in turn creates an ingrained aversion to harm and suffering. However, harm and suffering have no objective existence; what gives them their existence and their power is only our aversion to them. When you understand this, you understand then that it is our aversion, in fact, that attracts to us every negativity and obstacle that can possibly happen to us, and fills our lives with nervous anxiety, expectation, and fear. Wear down that aversion by wearing down the self-grasping mind and its attachment to a nonexistent self, and you will wear down any hold on you that any obstacle or negativity can have. For how can you attack someone or something that is just not there? </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is compassion, then, that is the best protection; it is also, as the great masters of the past have always known, the source of all healing. Suppose you have a disease such as cancer or AIDS. By taking on the sickness of those suffering like you, in addition to your own pain, with a mind full of compassion you will—beyond any doubt—purify the past negative karma that is the cause, now and in the future, of the continuation of your suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet, I remember hearing, there were many extraordinary cases of people, who when they heard they were dying of a terminal illness, gave away everything they had and went to the cemetery to die. There they practiced taking on the suffering of others; and what is amazing is that instead of dying, they returned home, fully healed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Working with the dying, I have experienced again and again, gives all who do so a direct opportunity to practice compassion in action, and in the situation where it is probably most deeply needed of all. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Your compassion can have perhaps three essential benefits for the dying person: First, because it is opening your heart, you will find it easier to show the dying person the kind of unconditional love I have spoken about, and which they need so much. On a deeper, spiritual level, I have seen again and again how, if you try to embody compassion and act out of the heart of compassion, you will create an atmosphere in which the other person can be inspired to imagine the spiritual dimension or even take up spiritual practice. On the deepest level of all, if you do constantly practice compassion for </p>
 the dying person and in turn inspire them to do the same, you might not only heal them spiritually, but perhaps even physically too. And you will discover for yourself, with wonder, what all the spiritual masters know, that <i class="calibre3"> the power of compassion</i> <i class="calibre3">has no bounds. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Asanga was one of the most famous Indian Buddhist saints, and lived in the fourth century. He went to the mountains to do a solitary retreat, concentrating all his meditation practice on the Buddha Maitreya, in the fervent hope that he would be blessed with a vision of this Buddha and receive teachings from him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For six years Asanga meditated in extreme hardship, but did not even have one auspicious dream. He was disheartened and thought he would never succeed with his aspiration to meet the Buddha Maitreya, so he abandoned his retreat and left his hermitage. He had not gone far down the road when he saw a man rubbing an enormous iron bar with a strip of silk. Asanga went up to him and asked him what he was doing. "I haven't got a needle," the man replied, "so I'm going to make one out of this iron bar." Asanga stared at him, astounded; even if the man were able to manage it in a hundred years, he thought, what would be the point? He said to himself: "Look at the trouble people give themselves over things that are totally absurd. You are doing something really valuable, spiritual practice, and you're not nearly so dedicated." </p>
<p class="calibre2">He turned around and went back to his retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Another three years went by, still without the slightest sign from the Buddha Maitreya. "Now I know for certain," he thought "I'm never going to succeed." So he left again, and soon came to a bend in the road where there was a huge rock, so tall it seemed to touch the sky. At the foot of the rock was a man busily rubbing it with a feather soaked in water. "What are you doing?" Asanga asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"This rock is so big it's stopping the sun from shining on my house, so I'm trying to get rid of it." Asanga was amazed at the man's indefatigable energy, and ashamed at his own lack of dedication. He returned to his retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Three more years passed, and still he had not even had a single good dream. He decided, once and for all, that it was hopeless, and he left his retreat for good. The day wore on, and in the afternoon he came across a dog lying by the side of 196 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">the road. It had only its front legs, and the whole of the lower part of its body was rotting and covered with maggots. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite its pitiful condition, the dog was snapping at passers-by, and pathetically trying to bite them by dragging itself along the ground with its two good legs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Asanga was overwhelmed with a vivid and unbearable feeling of compassion. He cut a piece of flesh off his own body and gave it to the dog to eat. Then he bent down to take off the maggots that were consuming the dog's body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But he suddenly thought he might hurt them if he tried to pull them out with his fingers, and he realized that the only way to remove them would be on his tongue. Asanga knelt on the ground, and looking at the horrible festering, writhing mass, closed his eyes. He leant closer and put out his tongue </p>
<p class="calibre2">. . . The next thing he knew, his tongue was touching the ground. He opened his eyes and looked up. The dog was gone; there in its place was the Buddha Maitreya, ringed by a shimmering aura of light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"At last," said Asanga. "Why did you never appear to me before?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">Maitreya spoke softly: "It is not true that I have never appeared to you before. I was with you all the time, but your negative karma and obscurations prevented you from seeing me. Your twelve years of practice dissolved them slightly, so that you were at last able to see the dog. Then, thanks to your genuine and heartfelt compassion, all those obscurations were completely swept away, and you can see me before you with your very own eyes. If you don't believe that this is what happened, put me on your shoulder and try and see if anyone else can see me." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Asanga put Maitreya on his right shoulder and went to the marketplace, where he began to ask everyone: "What have I got on my shoulder?" "Nothing," most people said, and hur-ried on. Only one old woman, whose karma had been slightly purified, answered: "You've got the rotting corpse of an old dog on your shoulder, that's all." Asanga at last understood the boundless power of compassion that had purified and transformed his karma, and so made him a vessel fit to receive the vision and instruction of Maitreya. Then the Buddha Maitreya, whose name means "loving kindness," took Asanga to a heavenly realm, and there gave him many sublime teachings that are among the most important in the whole of Buddhism. </p>

<p class="calibre2">THE STORY OF TONGLEN<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">AND THE POWER OF COMPASSION </p>
<p class="calibre2">My students often come to me and ask: "My friend's or my relative's suffering is disturbing me very much, and I really want to help. But I find I cannot feel enough love actually to be able to help. The compassion I want to show is blocked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What can I do?" Haven't all of us surely known the sad frustration of not being able to find in our hearts enough love and compassion for the people who are suffering around us, and so not enough strength to help them? </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the great qualities of the Buddhist tradition is its development of an array of practices that can really help you in situations like this, that can truly nourish you and fill you with the power and the joyful resourcefulness and enthusiasm that will enable you to purify your mind and unblock your heart, so that the healing energies of wisdom and compassion can play upon and transform the situation you find yourself in. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Of all the practices I know, the practice of <i class="calibre3"> Tonglen, </i> which in Tibetan means "giving and receiving," is one of the most useful and powerful. When you feel yourself locked in upon yourself, Tonglen opens you to the truth of the suffering of others; when your heart is blocked, it destroys those forces that are obstructing it; and when you feel estranged from the person who is in pain before you, or bitter or despairing, it helps you to find within yourself and then to reveal the loving, expansive radiance of your own true nature. No other practice I know is as effective in destroying the self-grasping, self-cherishing, and self-absorption of the ego, which is the root of all our suffering and the root of all hard-heartedness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the greatest masters of Tonglen in Tibet was Geshe Chekhawa, who lived in the twelfth century. He was extremely learned and accomplished in many different forms of meditation. One day when he happened to be in his teacher's room, he came across a book lying open at the following lines: </p>
