<p class="calibre2">8. From the Guru Yoga in Jikme Lingpa's famous preliminary practice to his cycle of Dzogchen teachings: <i class="calibre3"> Longchen Nyingtik,</i> 9. Dilgo Khyentse,  <i class="calibre3"> The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, </i> 83. </p>
<p class="calibre2">10. <b class="calibre4"> </b>THE INNERMOST ESSENCE<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">1. The Ngondro is divided traditionally into two parts. The Outer Preliminaries, beginning with the Invocation of the Lama, consist of contemplation on the uniqueness of human life, impermanence, karma, and the suffering of samsara. The Inner Preliminaries are Taking Refuge, Generating Bodhicitta (the Heart of the Enlightened Mind), Vajrasattva purification, Mandala Offering, and then finally, Guru Yoga, followed by the Phowa (the Transference of Consciousness) and the dedication. </p>
<p class="calibre2">2. This is not the place to explore in detail these preliminary practices. I hope in the future to be able to publish a full explanation of them for those who are interested in following them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. Dzogchen Monastery was a monastic university founded in the seventeenth century in Kham, eastern Tibet, which was one of the largest and most influential centers of the tradition of Padmasambhava and the Dzogchen teachings until its destruction by the Chinese in 1959. It had a renowned study college, and produced scholars and teachers of the very highest caliber, such as Patrul Rinpoche (1808-87) and  M p h a m (1846-1912). With the blessing of the Dalai Lama, the monastery has been rebuilt in exile by the Seventh Dzogchen Rinpoche in Mysore in the south of India. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4. Quoted in Tulku Thondup Rinpoche,  <i class="calibre3"> Buddha Mind, </i> 128. </p>
<p class="calibre2">5. A mandala usually means the sacred environment and dwelling of a buddha, bodhisattva, or deity, which is visualized by the practitioner in Tantric practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">6. One sure way I have found of discerning whether you are in the state of Rigpa is by the presence of its sky-like Essence, its radiant Nature, and its unimpeded Energy of compassion, as well as the five wisdoms, with their qualities of openness, precision, all-embracing equality, discernment, and spontaneous accomplishment, as described on page 157. </p>
<p class="calibre2">7. Through the practice of Togal, an accomplished practitioner can realize the three kayas in one lifetime (see Chapter 21, "The Universal Process"). This is the Fruition of Dzogchen. </p>

<p class="calibre2">12. COMPASSION: THE WISH-FULFILLING JEWEL </p>
<p class="calibre2">1. Often people have asked me: "Does this mean that it is somehow wrong to look after ourselves, and care for our own needs?" It cannot be said too often that the self-cherishing which is destroyed by compassion is <i class="calibre3"> the grasping and cherishing of a false self</i><b class="calibre4"> </b>as we saw in<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Chapter 8. To say that self-cherishing is the root of all harm should never be misunderstood as meaning either that it is selfish, or wrong, to be kind to ourselves or that by simply thinking of others our problems will dissolve of their own accord. As I have explained in Chapter 5, being generous to ourselves, making friends with ourselves, and uncovering our own kindness and confidence, are central to, and implicit in, the teachings. We uncover our own Good Heart, our fundamental goodness, and that is the aspect of ourselves that we identify with and encourage. We shall see later in this chapter, in the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Tonglen" practice, how important it is to begin by working on ourselves, strengthening our love and compassion, before going on to help others. Otherwise our "help" could ultimately be motivated by a subtle selfishness; it could become just a burden to others; it could even make them dependent on us, so robbing them of the opportunity to take responsibility for themselves, and obstructing their development. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Psychotherapists say too that one of the core tasks for their clients is to develop self-respect and "positive self-regard," to heal their feelings of lack and inner impoverishment, and to allow them the experience of well-being that is an essential part of our development as human beings. </p>

<p class="calibre2">6. The teachings define these four "immeasurable qualities" with great precision: loving kindness is the wish to bring happiness to those who lack happiness; compassion is the desire to free those who are suffering from their suffering; joy is the wish that the happiness people have found will never desert them; and equanimity is to see NOTES 407 </p>
<p class="calibre2">and treat all without bias, attachment, or aversion, but with boundless love and compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">7. Bodhichitta is categorized in a number of ways. The distinction between "Bodhichitta in aspiration" and "Bodhichitta in action" is portrayed by Shantideva as being like the difference between decid-ing to go somewhere and making the voyage. Bodhichitta is also categorized into "relative," or "conventional Bodhichitta," and "ultimate Bodhichitta." Relative Bodhichitta entails the compassionate wish to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all living beings, and the training outlined here. Ultimate Bodhichitta is the direct insight into the ultimate nature of things. </p>

<p class="calibre2">6. One text explains: "The route through which the consciousness escapes determines the future rebirth. If it escapes through the anus, rebirth will be in the hell realm; if through the genital organ, the animal realm; if through the mouth, the hungry ghost realm; if through the nose, the human and spirit realms; if through the navel, the realm of 'desire gods'; if through the ears, the demigods; if through the eyes, the 'form god; realm; and if through the top of the head (four finger-widths back from the hairline), the 'formless god' realm. If the consciousness escapes through the crown of the head, the being will be reborn in Dewachen, the western paradise of Amitabha."

<p class="calibre2">8. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche told me of a number of such cases. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When the famous Dzogchen master Khenpo Ngakchung was still a young boy, he once saw the corpse of a calf that had died of starva-tion at the end of winter. He was filled with compassion and prayed strongly for the animal, visualizing its consciousness traveling to the paradise of Buddha Amitabha. At that moment a hole appeared in the top of the calf's skull, from which blood and fluid flowed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">9. There are also certain buddhas who pledged that whoever hears their name at the moment of death will be helped. Simply reciting their names into the ear of the dying person can be of benefit. This is also done for animals when they die. </p>
<p class="calibre2">10. Literally the "prana-mind": one master explains that "prana" </p>
<p class="calibre2">expresses mind's aspect of mobility, and "mind" its aspect of awareness, but they are essentially one and the same thing. </p>

<p class="calibre2">2. It is said that there are only two places the mental body cannot go: the womb of its future mother and Vajrasana, the place where all the buddhas become enlightened. These two places represent the entrance to samsata and nirvana. In other words, to be reborn or gain enlightenment would bring an end to its life in this bardo. </p>

<p class="calibre2">2. Yet, in the case of a spiritual practitioner who has died, and who sees friends and relatives grasping and insincere after his death, it is possible that instead of being hurt and angry, he might be able to realize that all their behavior is simply the nature of samsara. From this he might generate a deep sense of renunciation and compassion, which could be of great benefit to him in the bardo of becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. When we ask a master to practice and pray for a dead person, it is a custom to send a donation of money, however small it might be. The donation establishes a tangible connection between the dead person and the master, who will always use this money exclusively to pay for the rituals for the dead, or make offerings at holy shrines, or dedicate it in their name to his or her work. </p>

I look forward to organizing training programs in the future on the Buddhist approach to death and caring for the dying that will include some of these methods.

<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Acknowledgments </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">IN THE TASK OF PRESENTING the teachings contained in this book authentically, and yet in a way that reaches out to modern minds, I have been continually inspired by the example of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and by how he embodies all the authenticity and purity of the tradition while displaying an all-embracing openness to the modern world. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are no words to express the depth of my gratitude to him; he is a constant source of courage and inspiration not only to the Tibetan people, but also to countless individuals all over the world whose hearts have been moved and whose lives have been transformed by his message. I have been told that the connection I have with him stretches back over many lives, and in the strength and closeness of the affinity I feel for him, I somewhere know this to be true. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For their inspiration and their teachings, the essence of which are this book, I thank every one of my masters, and I offer it to them all. Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro, who recognized me and brought me up, gave me the ground and the meaning of life; he gave me in fact the two most precious things I have: devotion and understanding. His spiritual wife, Khandro Tsering Chodron, the foremost yogini in Tibetan Buddhism, has, in her love and care, been truly like a master to me as well; for me she is completely inseparable from Jamyang Khyentse, and I only have to think of her to see his majestic presence reflected in her. She is like a spiritual mother to me: I feel always protected on account of her prayers and her love, and I pray that she lives for many, many more years. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Dudjom Rinpoche who made flower those seeds of understanding Jamyang Khyentse had sowed in me, through his personal kindness and his teaching. The affection he showed me was almost, I sometimes think, as though I had been his own son. And then Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was 419 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">420 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p>
<p class="calibre2">there to deepen whatever understanding I have and to give it eloquence. As the years went by, he took on more and more the role of teacher for me, with the personal attention and advice he gave me so freely, and with his gentle, unending kindness. Increasingly, when I have thought of "the master," </p>
<p class="calibre2">my mind has turned to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and he became for me the embodiment of the entire teaching, a real living Buddha. </p>
<p class="calibre2">These great masters continue to move me and guide me always, and not a day goes by that I do not remember them and their unrepayable kindness, and talk about them to my students and friends. I pray that something of their wisdom, compassion, and power, and their vision for humanity, may live through the pages of this book they have so inspired. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nor shall I ever forget my uncle Gyalwang Karmapa, who showed me such special affection from my childhood on, and the very thought of whom moves me to tears. I often think too of the great Kalu Rinpoche, the Milarepa of our times, who gave me enormous encouragement through his belief in me, and in the warmth and respect with which he treated me. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to acknowledge here as well the debt of inspiration I owe to other great teachers, such as His Holiness Sakya Trizin, a close friend from my childhood, who has been my teacher and yet also like a brother, encouraging me at every turn. I give my deep thanks to Dodrupchen Rinpoche, who is a constant guide, especially on this book, and a source of refuge to me and to all of my students. Some of the most precious moments over recent years have been spent with Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche, with whom I had the great good fortune to clarify the teachings in the light of his seemingly limitless learning and wisdom. Two other outstanding and eminent masters who have been special springs of inspiration to me are Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and Trulshik Rinpoche, and I must thank also the very learned Khenpo Appey and Khenpo Lodro Zangpo, who played such an important part in my studies and education. Nor will I ever forget Gyalton Rinpoche, who showed me such kindness after my master, Jamyang Khyentse, had passed away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I wish to pay special tribute to the encouragement and marvellous vision of Penor Rinpoche, an outstanding master who works tirelessly to maintain the unbroken transmission of the rich tradition of teachings that come directly from Padmasambhava. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  4 2 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am deeply grateful to Dudjom Rinpoche's family: his wife, Sangyum Kusho Rikzin Wangmo, for her kindness and understanding, and his son and daughters, Shenphen Rinpoche, Chime Wangmo, and Tsering Penzom, for their constant support. For their warm and generous help, I would like to thank too both Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, whose work has inspired parts of this book, and Tulku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, who has been so instrumental in bringing the teachings and the greatest teachers to the West. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the younger generation of masters, I must single out Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, the "activity emanation" of my master Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro. The brilliance and freshness of his teaching continue to fascinate me and fill me with great hope for the future. Likewise I should like to thank, for his wonderful and spontaneous help, Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche, who is the heir to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and who received teachings from him continuously from the age of five. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am always moved and encouraged too by a master who is very close to my heart, whose work and mine are one: Dzogchen Rinpoche. Having now reconstructed the famous Dzogchen Monastery with immense vitality in southern India, he has already taken on, in his learning and the dazzling purity and natural simplicity of his presence, the bearing of the great master he will be in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A number of masters have answered in detail certain specific questions about the teachings presented in this book: His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche, Trulshik Rinpoche, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, Lati Rinpoche, and Alak Zenkar Rinpoche. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To them I am deeply grateful. I would like to express my gratitude as well to Ringu Tulku Rinpoche, for his friendship over the years, his kind and constant help to both my students and myself, and his wonderful translation work, which includes the translation of this book into Tibetan. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I wish to thank and salute the pioneers of the Buddhist teachings, those masters of different traditions whose work has for decades brought help to so many people in the West. I think especially of Suzuki Roshi, Chogyam Trungpa, Tarthang Tulku, and Thich Nhat Hanh. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like also to thank my mother and my late father for their support, and all the help they have given me to accomplish what I have done so far: my late father, Tsewang 4 2 2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p>
<p class="calibre2">Paljor, who was Jamyang Khyentse's secretary and personal assistant from the age of eighteen, was himself a great practitioner and yogin; and my mother, Tsering Wangmo, who has always urged me onward and encouraged me in my work. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My gratitude goes too to my brother, Thigyal, and my sister, Dechen, for all their help and loyalty. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Let me express here my gratitude to the country of Sikkim and its people, the late King, the Queen Mother, the late Crown Prince Tenzin Namgyal, the present King Wangchuk, and all the royal family, as well as Professor Nirmal C. Sinha, former director of the Sikkim Research Institute. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone who was always a great source of inspiration and encouragement to me, and especially in this book, was David Bohm, to whom I would like to express my gratitude. I also wish to thank a number of other scientists and scholars, especially Dr. Kenneth Ring, an old friend of mine; Dr. Basil Hiley; and Geshe Thubten Jinpa, His Holiness the Dalai Lama's translator, who very kindly read through parts of this book, and offered their advice. I would like to thank Tenzin Geyche Tethong, H.H. the Dalai Lama's secretary; Lodi Gyari Rinpoche, Special Envoy of H.H. the Dalai Lama and President of the International Campaign for Tibet; and Konchog Tenzin, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's secretary and attendant, for their help. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My thanks also go to my friend Andrew Harvey, a well-known and very gifted writer, for the dedicated, impassioned, and selfless way in which he has shaped this book and helped the majesty of the teachings to shine through the words with radiant simplicity and brilliance. He offers his work to his own masters: to Thuksey Rinpoche, whom I remember well as someone who positively radiated with love, and who looked on me with so much affection that I have always longed to repay his kindness; and to Mother Meera and her work of harmony between all religions in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I thank Patrick Gaffney for his unfailing patience, his devoted perseverance, his ardor, and the sacrifices he has made to see this book through its many transformations over many years. He is one of my oldest and closest students; and if anyone were to understand my mind or my work, it is him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This book is as much his book as mine, for without him I cannot imagine that it would have been possible. I would like to dedicate this work to his own spiritual development, and to the happiness of all beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I am grateful to Christine Longaker for all the invaluable insights she has shared with me from her long experience of helping the dying, and teaching on death and dying. I must salute also Harold Talbott, one of my first Western friends and students, as well as Michael Baldwin, for their dedication in helping establish the teaching of Buddha in the West, and for the encouragement they have always given me. At Harper San Francisco, I should like to thank Amy Hertz, Michael Toms, and all the staff for their priceless and enthusiastic assistance with this book. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to take this opportunity also to thank Philip Philippou, Dominique Side, Mary Ellen Rouiller, Sandra Pawula, Doris Wolter, Ian Maxwell, Giles Oliver, Lisa Brewer, Dominique Cowell, Sabah Cheraiet, Tom Bottoms, and Ross Mackay for their continuous help and dedication, and John Cleese, Alex Leith, Alan Madsen, Bokara Legendre, Lavinia Currier, Peter and Harriet Cornish, Robin Relph, and Patrick Naylor for their vision and support. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I thank all my students and friends who in a way have been like teachers to me, who have shared this book at every stage of its making, and who have put up with me with their deep devotion. They are a constant source of inspiration to me. My gratitude goes to those too who have truly worked with these teachings and put them into practice, especially those who are caring for the dying and bereaved, and who have contributed many useful insights to this book. I am moved by the efforts of all my students in trying to understand and apply the teachings, and I pray that they will be successful. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have done my best here to convey the heart of the teachings, and for whatever is missing, whatever imprecision or errors there may be, I ask the reader's indulgence, and pray that my masters and the protectors of the teachings forgive me! </p>
