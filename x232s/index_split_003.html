<p class="calibre2">The vast and almost unimaginable compassion of these lines astounded him, and he set out to find the master who had written them. One day on his journey he met a leper, who told him that this master had died. But Geshe Chekhawa 198 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">persevered , an d his long effort s wer e rewarded when he foun d th e dea d master' s principa l disciple . Gesh e Chekhaw a asked thi s disciple : "just  ho w important do you think th e teachings contained in thes e two lines are? "  Th e discipl e replied : </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Whether  you like it or  not , you will hav e to practice thi s teaching if you truly wish to attain buddhahood." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thi s repl y astonished Geshe Chekhawa almos t as muc h as his first reading of th e tw o lines, and he staye d with thi s disciple for  twelve years, to study thi s teaching an d to tak e to heart th e practice of Tonglen , which is its practical application. </p>
<p class="calibre2">During that time , Gesh e Chekhawa ha d to face many differ -</p>
<p class="calibre2">ent kinds of ordeals: all sort s of difficulties, criticism, hard -</p>
<p class="calibre2">ships , an d abuse. And th e teaching was so effective, an d his perseverance in its practice so intense, that after  six years he had completely eradicated any self grasping and self-cherishing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The practice of Tonglen ha d transformed him into a master  of compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At first Geshe Chekhawa taught Tonglen to only a few close disciples , thinking that it would only work for  those wh o ha d grea t faith in it. The n he bega n to teac h it to a group of lepers. Leprosy at that tim e was commo n in Tibet, an d ordinary doctors wer e unable to treat or  cur e it. But many of th e lepers wh o did Tongle n practice wer e cured. Th e news of thi s spread fast, an d othe r  lepers flocked to his house , which began to seem like a hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Still Gesh e Chekhawa didn't teach Tongle n widely. It was only whe n he notice d th e effect it had on his brother  that he began to give it out more publicly. Gesh e Chekhawa's brother was an inveterate skeptic, who derided all forms of spiritual practice. However, when he saw what  was happening to the lepers who were practicing Tonglen, this brother could not help being impressed an d intrigued. One da y he hid behind a door  and listened to Gesh e Chekhawa teaching Tonglen, an d then , in secret , started doin g th e practice on his own. When Gesh e Chekhawa notice d that his brother's hard character  was beginning to soften, he guessed what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If thi s practice could work on his brother, he thought, and transform him , then it could work on an d transform an y other human being . Thi s convince d Gesh e Chekhawa to teac h Tongle n far  more widely. He himself never  ceased to practice it. Toward th e end of his life, Gesh e Chekhawa told his stu -</p>
<p class="calibre2">dents that for  a long time he ha d been praying fervently to be reborn in the hell realms, so as to be of help to all th e beings suffering there. Unfortunately, he added , he had recently had </p>
<p class="calibre2">several clear dreams that indicated he was to be reborn in one of the realms of the buddhas. He was bitterly disappointed and begged his students, with tears in his eyes, to pray to the buddhas that this would not happen, and that his passionate wish to help the beings in hell would be fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre2">HOW TO AWAKEN LOVE AND COMPASSION </p>
<p class="calibre2">Before you can truly practice Tonglen, you have to be able to evoke compassion in yourself. That is harder than we often imagine, because the sources of our love and compassion are sometimes hidden from us, and we may have no ready access to them. Fortunately there are several special techniques that the Buddhist "training of the mind" in compassion has developed to help us evoke our own hidden love. Out of the enormous range of methods available, I have selected the following ones, and have ordered them in a particular way so as to be of the greatest possible use to people in the modern world. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">1. Loving Kindness: Unsealing the Spring </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">When we believe that we don't have enough love in us, there is a method for discovering and invoking it. Go back in your mind and recreate, almost visualize, a love that someone gave you that really moved you, perhaps in your childhood. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Traditionally you are taught to think of your mother and her lifelong devotion to you, but if you find that problematic, you could think of your grandmother or grandfather, or anyone who had been deeply kind to you in your life. Remember a particular instance when they really showed you love and you felt their love vividly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now let that feeling arise again in your heart and infuse you with gratitude. As you do so, your love will go out naturally to that person who evoked it. You will remember then that even though you may not always feel that you have been loved enough, you were loved genuinely once. Knowing that now will make you feel again that you are, as that person made you feel then, worthy of love and really lovable. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Let your heart open now and let love flow from it; then extend this love to all beings. Begin with those who are closest to you, then extend your love to friends and to acquaintances, then to neighbors, to strangers, then even to those whom you don't like or have difficulties with, even those whom you might consider as your "enemies," and finally to the whole universe. Let this love become more and more 200 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">boundless. Equanimity is one of the four essential facets, with loving kindness, compassion, and joy, of what the teachings say form the entire aspiration of compassion. The all-inclusive, unbiased view of equanimity is really the starting point and the basis of the path of compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You will find that this practice unseals a spring of love, and by that unsealing in you of your own loving kindness, you will find that it will inspire the birth of compassion. For as Maitreya said in one of the teachings he gave Asanga: "The water of compassion courses through the canal of loving kindness." </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Compassion: Considering Yourself the Same as Others</i> One powerful way to evoke compassion, as I have described in the previous chapter, is to think of others as exactly the same as you. "After all," the Dalai Lama explains, </p>
<p class="calibre2">"all human beings are the same—made of human flesh, bones, and blood. We all want happiness and want to avoid suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Further, we have an equal right to be happy. In other words, it is important to realize our sameness as human beings."3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Say, for example, you are having difficulties with a loved one, such as your mother or father, husband or wife, lover or friend. How helpful and revealing it can be to consider the other person not in his or her "role" of mother or father or husband, but simply as another "you," another human being, with the same feelings as you, the same desire for happiness, the same fear of suffering. Thinking of the person as a real person, exactly the same as you, will open your heart to him or her and give you more insight into how to help. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you consider others just the same as yourself, it will help you to open up your relationships and give them a new and richer meaning. Imagine if societies and nations began to view each other in the same way; at last we would have the beginnings of a solid basis for peace on earth and the happy coexis-tence of all peoples. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">3. Compassion: Exchanging Yourself for Others</i> When someone is suffering and you find yourself at a loss to know how to help, put yourself unflinchingly in his or her place. Imagine as vividly as possible what you would be going through if you were suffering the same pain. Ask yourself: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"How would I feel? How would I want my friends to treat me? What would I most want from them?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you exchange yourself for others in this way, you are directly transferring your cherishing from its usual object, yourself, to other beings. So exchanging yourself for others is a very powerful way of loosening the hold on you of the self-cherishing and the self-grasping of ego, and so of releasing the heart of your compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4 <i class="calibre3">. Using a Friend to Generate Compassion </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Another moving technique for arousing compassion for a person who is suffering is to imagine one of your dearest friends, or someone you really love, in that person's place. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine your brother or daughter or parent or best friend in the same kind of painful situation. Quite naturally your heart will open, and compassion will awaken in you: What more would you want than to free them from their torment? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now take this compassion released in your heart and transfer it to the person who needs your help: You will find that your help is inspired more naturally, and that you can direct it more easily. </p>
<p class="calibre2">People sometimes ask me: "If I do this, will the friend or relative whom I am imagining in pain come to some harm?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, thinking about them with such love and compassion can only be of help to them, and will even bring about the healing of whatever suffering and pain they may have gone through in the past, may be going through now, or have yet to go through. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For the fact that they are the instrument of your arousing compassion, even if it is only for an instant, will bring them tremendous merit and benefit. Because they have been responsible, in part, for the opening of your heart, and for allowing you to help the sick or dying person with your compassion, then the merit from that action will naturally return to them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">You can also mentally dedicate the merit of that action to your friend or relative who helped you to open your heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And you can wish the person well, and pray that in the future he or she will be free of suffering. You will be grateful toward your friend, and your friend might feel inspired and grateful too, if you tell the person that he or she helped you to evoke your compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So to ask, "Will my friend or relative I am imagining in place of the sick or dying person come to some harm?" shows that we have not really understood how powerful and miraculous the working of compassion is. It blesses and heals all those involved: the person who generates compassion, the person through whom that compassion is generated, and the 202 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">person to whom that compassion is directed. As Portia says in Shakespeare's <i class="calibre3"> Merchant of Venice: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The quality of mercy is not strained, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</i> <i class="calibre3">Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;</i> <i class="calibre3">It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes ... </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Compassion is the wish-fulfilling gem whose light of healing spreads in all directions. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a very beautiful story that I love that illustrates this. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Buddha once recounted one of his previous lives, before he became enlightened. A great emperor had three sons, and the Buddha had been the youngest, who was called Mahasattva. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mahasattva was by nature a loving and compassionate little boy, and thought of all living things as his children. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One day the emperor and his court went to picnic in a forest, and the princes went off to play in the woods. After a while they came across a tigress who had given birth, and was so exhausted with hunger that she was on the point of eating her little cubs. Mahasattva asked his brothers: "What would the tigress need to eat now to revive her?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Only fresh meat or blood," they replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who could give his own flesh and blood to see that she is fed and save the lives of her and her cubs?" he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Who, indeed?" they replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mahasattva was deeply moved by the plight of the tigress and her cubs, and started to think: "For so long I have been wandering uselessly through samsara, life after life, and because of my desire, anger, and ignorance, have done little to help other beings. Here at last is a great opportunity." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The princes were walking back to join their family, when Mahasattva said: "You two go on ahead. I will catch you up later." Quietly he crept back to the tigress, went right up to her, and lay down on the ground in front of her, to offer himself to her as food. The tigress looked at him, but was so weak that she could not even open her mouth. So the prince found a sharp stick and cut a deep gash in his body; the blood flowed out, the tigress licked it, and she grew strong enough to open her jaws and eat him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mahasattva had given his body to the tigress in order to save her cubs, and through the great merit of his compassion, he was reborn in a higher realm and progressed toward his enlightenment and his rebirth as the Buddha. But it was not only himself he had helped through his action: The power of his compassion had also purified the tigress and her cubs of their karma, and even of any karmic debt they might have owed to him for saving their lives in the way he did. Because it was so strong, in fact, his compassionate act created a karmic link between them that was to continue far into the future. The tigress and her cubs, who received the flesh of Mahasattva's body, were reborn, it is said, as the Buddha's first five disciples, the very first to receive his teaching after his enlightenment. What a vision this story gives us of how vast and mysterious the power of compassion truly is! </p>
<p class="calibre2">5.  <i class="calibre3"> How to Meditate on Compassion </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, as I have said, evoking this power of compassion in us is not always easy. I find myself that the simplest ways are the best and the most direct. Every day, life gives us innumerable chances to open our hearts, if we can only take them. An old woman passes you with a sad and lonely face, swollen veins on her legs, and two heavy plastic bags full of shopping she can hardly carry; a shabbily dressed old man shuffles in front of you in line at the post office; a boy on crutches looks harried and anxious as he tries to cross the street in the afternoon traffic; a dog lies bleeding to death on the road; a young girl sits alone, sobbing hysterically in the subway. Switch on a television, and there on the news perhaps is a mother in Beirut kneeling above the body of her murdered son; or an old grandmother in Moscow pointing to the soup that is her food for today, not knowing if she'll even have that tomorrow; or one of the AIDS children in Romania staring out at you with eyes drained of any living expression. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Any one of these sights could open the eyes of your heart to the fact of vast suffering in the world. Let it. Don't waste the love and grief it arouses; in the moment you feel compassion welling up in you, don't brush it aside, don't shrug it off and try quickly to return to "normal," don't be afraid of your feeling or embarrassed by it, don't allow yourself to be distracted from it or let it run aground in apathy. Be vulnerable: use that quick, bright uprush of compassion; focus on it, go deep into your heart and meditate on it, develop it, enhance, and deepen it. By doing this you will realize how blind you have been to suffering, how the pain that you are experiencing or seeing now is only a tiny fraction of the pain of the world. All beings, everywhere, suffer; let your heart go out to them all in spontaneous and immeasurable compassion, and 204 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">direct that compassion, along with the blessing of all the Buddhas, to the alleviation of suffering everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Compassion is a far greater and nobler thing than pity. Pity has its roots in fear, and a sense of arrogance and condescen-sion, sometimes even a smug feeling of "I'm glad it's not me." </p>
<p class="calibre2">As Stephen Levine says: "When your fear touches someone's pain it becomes pity; when your love touches someone's pain, it becomes compassion."4 To train in compassion, then, is to know all beings are the same and suffer in similar ways, to honor all those who suffer, and to know you are neither separate from nor superior to anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So your first response on seeing someone suffer becomes not mere pity, but deep compassion. You feel for that person respect and even gratitude, because you now know that whoever prompts you to develop compassion by their suffering is in fact giving you one of the greatest gifts of all, because they are helping you to develop that very quality you need most in your progress toward enlightenment. That is why we say in Tibet that the beggar who is asking you for money, or the sick old woman wringing your heart, may be the buddhas in disguise, manifesting on your path to help you grow in compassion and so move towards buddhahood. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">6. How to Direct Your Compassion </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">When you meditate deeply enough on compassion, there will arise in you a strong determination to alleviate the suffering of all beings, and an acute sense of responsibility toward that noble aim. There are two ways, then, of mentally directing this compassion and making it active. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The first way is to pray to all the buddhas and enlightened beings, from the depths of your heart, that everything you do, all your thoughts, words, and deeds, should only benefit beings and bring them happiness. In the words of one great prayer: "Bless me into usefulness." Pray that you benefit all who come in contact with you, and help them transform their suffering and their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The second and universal way is to direct whatever compassion you have to all beings, by dedicating all your positive actions and spiritual practice to their welfare and especially toward their enlightenment. For when you meditate deeply on compassion, a realization dawns in you that the only way for you to be of <i class="calibre3"> complete</i> help to other beings is for you to gain enlightenment. From that a strong sense of determination and universal responsibility is born, and the compassionate wish arises in you at that moment to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all others. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This compassionate wish is called Bodhichitta in Sanskrit; <i class="calibre3">bodhi</i> means our enlightened essence, and <i class="calibre3"> chitta</i> means heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So we could translate it as "the heart of our enlightened mind." To awaken and develop the heart of the enlightened mind is to ripen steadily the seed of our buddha nature, that seed that in the end, when our practice of compassion has become perfect and all-embracing, will flower majestically into buddhahood. Bodhichitta, then, is the spring and source and root of the entire spiritual path. That is why Shantideva could praise Bodhichitta with such joy: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the supreme elixir </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That overcomes the sovereignty of death. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the inexhaustible treasure </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That eliminates poverty in the world. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the supreme medicine </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That quells the world's disease. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the tree that shelters all beings </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Wandering and tired on the path of conditioned existence. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the universal bridge </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That leads to freedom from unhappy states of birth. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the dawning moon of the mind </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">That dispels the torment of disturbing conceptions. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">It is the great sun that finally removes </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The misty ignorance of the world.5 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">And this is why in our tradition we pray with such urgency: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Bodhichitta, precious and sublime: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May it arise in those in whom it has not arisen;</i> <i class="calibre3">May it never decline where it has arisen;</i> <i class="calibre3">But go on increasing, further and further! </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Patrul Rinpoche used these four lines to encapsulate the entire training in Bodhichitta, "the wish," as Maitreya described it, "to attain perfect enlightenment for the sake of others." Let me briefly oudine this training. It begins by developing within your mind loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity toward limitless living beings.6 Through a practice of deep contemplation, you cultivate these four qualities to such a degree that they become boundless and immeasurable. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">206 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">And so Bodhichitta "arises where it has not arisen" for this has brought you to a point where you are impelled by an almost heartbreaking urge to take responsibility for others, and so to pledge yourself truly to arouse the heart of the enlightened mind by training in what are called "Bodhichitta in aspiration" and "Bodhichitta in action."7 The former is to train in considering yourself the same as others, then in exchanging yourself with others, which includes the Tonglen practice, and finally in considering others even more important than yourself. The latter is to develop to perfection generosity, discipline, patience or endurance, diligence, concentration, and wisdom, all of them infused by a penetrating insight into the nature of reality itself. So the Bodhichitta "never declines where it has arisen" and goes on "increasing further and further." This, then, is the path of the bodhisattvas, the practice of the compassionate heart of the enlightened mind that, because undertaken for the benefit of all, leads directly to Buddhahood. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE STAGES OF TONGLEN </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that I have introduced you to the various methods of evoking compassion, and to the importance and power of compassion itself, I can give you the noble practice of Tonglen most effectively; for now you will have the motivation, the understanding, and the tools to do it for your greatest benefit and the greatest benefit of others. Tonglen is a Buddhist practice, but I strongly believe that anyone—anyone at all—can do it. Even if you have no religious faith, I urge you simply to try it. I have found Tonglen to be of the greatest possible help. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Put very simply, the Tonglen practice of giving and receiving is to take on the suffering and pain of others, and give them your happiness, well-being, and peace of mind. Like one of the methods of meditation practice I explained earlier, Tonglen uses the medium of the breath. As Geshe Chekhawa wrote: "Giving and receiving should be practiced alternately. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This alternation should be placed on the medium of the breath." </p>
<p class="calibre2">I know from my own experience how hard it is to imagine taking on the sufferings of others, and especially of sick and dying people, without first building in yourself a strength and confidence of compassion. It is this strength and this confidence that will give your practice the power to transmute their suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is why I always recommend that you begin the Tonglen practice for others by first practicing it on yourself. Before you send out love and compassion to others, you uncover, deepen, create, and strengthen them in yourself, and heal yourself of any reticence or distress or anger or fear that might create an obstacle to practicing Tonglen wholeheartedly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the years a way of teaching Tonglen has developed that many of my students have found very helpful and thera-peutic. It has four stages. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE PRELIMINARY TONGLEN PRACTICE<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The best way to do this practice, and any practice of Tonglen, is to begin by evoking and resting in the nature of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When you rest in the nature of mind and see all things directly as "empty," illusory, and dream-like, you are resting in the state of what is known as "ultimate" or "absolute" Bodhichitta, the true heart of the enlightened mind. The teachings compare absolute Bodhichitta to an inexhaustible treasury of generosity; and compassion, when understood in its profound-est sense, is known and seen as the natural radiance of the nature of mind, the skillful means that rises from the heart of wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Begin by sitting and bringing the mind home. Allow all your thoughts to settle, neither inviting them nor following them. Close your eyes if you wish. When you feel really calm and centered, alert yourself slightly and begin the practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1.  <i class="calibre3"> Environmental Tonglen </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">We all know how the moods and atmospheres of our mind have a great hold on us. Sit with your mind and feel its mood and atmosphere. If you feel your mood is uneasy, or the atmosphere is dark, then, as you breathe in, mentally absorb whatever is unwholesome; and as you breathe out, mentally give out calm, clarity, and joy, so purifying and healing the atmosphere and environment of your mind. This is why I call this first stage of the practice "environmental Tonglen." </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">2. Self Tonglen </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the purposes of this exercise, divide yourself into two aspects,  <i class="calibre3"> A</i> and <i class="calibre3"> B. A</i> is the aspect of you that is whole, compassionate, warm, and loving, like a true friend, really willing 208 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">to be there for you, responsive and open to you, without ever judging you, whatever your faults or shortcomings. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">B</i> is the aspect of you that has been hurt, that feels misunderstood and frustrated, bitter or angry, who might have been, for example, unjustly treated or abused as a child, or has suffered in relationships or been wronged by society. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, as you breathe in, imagine that <i class="calibre3"> A</i> opens his or her heart completely, and warmly and compassionately accepts and embraces all of <i class="calibre3"> B's</i> suffering and negativity and pain and hurt. Moved by this,  <i class="calibre3"> B</i> opens his or her heart and all pain and suffering melt away in this compassionate embrace. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As you breathe out, imagine <i class="calibre3"> A</i> sending out to <i class="calibre3"> B</i> all his or her healing love, warmth, trust, comfort, confidence, happiness, and joy. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3.  <i class="calibre3"> Tonglen in a Living Situation </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine vividly a situation where you have acted badly, one about which you feel guilty, and which you wince to even think about. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as you breathe in, accept total responsibility for your actions in that particular situation, without in any way trying to justify your behavior. Acknowledge exactly what you have done wrong, and wholeheartedly ask for forgiveness. Now, as you breathe out, send out reconciliation, forgiveness, healing, and understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So you breathe in blame, and breathe out the undoing of harm; you breathe in responsibility, breathe out healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This exercise is particularly powerful, and it may give you the courage to go to see the person whom you have wronged, and the strength and willingness to talk to them directly and actually ask for forgiveness from the depths of your heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4 <i class="calibre3">. Tonglen for Others </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine someone to whom you feel very close, particularly someone who is suffering and in pain. As you breathe in, imagine you take in all their suffering and pain with compassion, and as you breathe out, send your warmth, healing, love, joy, and happiness streaming out to them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, just as in the practice of loving kindness, gradually widen the circle of your compassion to embrace first other people whom you also feel very close to, then those whom you feel indifferent about, then those you dislike or have difficulty with, then even those you feel are actively monstrous and cruel. Allow your compassion to become universal, and to fold in its embrace all sentient beings, all beings, in fact, without any exception: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Sentient beings are as limitless as the whole of space:</i> <i class="calibre3">May they each effortlessly realize the nature of their mind,</i> <i class="calibre3">And may every single being of all the six realms, who has each</i> <i class="calibre3">been in one life or another my father or mother,</i> <i class="calibre3">Attain all together the ground of primordial perfection. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">What I have been giving in this section is a complete preliminary practice to the main Tonglen, which, as you will see, involves a much richer process of visualization. This preliminary practice works with your attitude of mind and heart, and prepares, opens, and inspires you. Not only does it, in its own right, enable you to heal the environment of your mind, your own suffering, and the pain of the past, and to begin to help, through your compassion, all sentient beings; but it also establishes and makes you intimate and familiar with the process of giving and receiving that finds its complete expression in the main practice of Tonglen. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MAIN TONGLEN PRACTICE </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Tonglen practice of giving and receiving, we <i class="calibre3"> take</i> on, <i class="calibre3">through compassion, </i> all the various mental and physical sufferings of all beings: their fear, frustration, pain, anger, guilt, bitterness, doubt, and rage; and we <i class="calibre3"> give</i> them,  <i class="calibre3"> through love, </i> all our happiness, and well-being, peace of mind, healing, and fulfillment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1. Before you begin this practice, sit quietly and bring your mind home. Then, making use of any of the exercises or methods I have described, whichever one you find really inspires you and works for you, meditate deeply on compassion. Summon and invoke the presence of all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and enlightened beings, so that, through their inspiration and blessing, compassion may be born in your heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">2. Imagine in front of you, as vividly and as poignantly as possible, someone you care for who is suffering. Try and imagine every aspect of the person's pain and distress. Then, as you feel your heart opening in compassion toward the person, imagine that all of his or her sufferings manifest together and gather into a great mass of hot, black, grimy smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">210 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. Now, as you breathe in, visualize this mass of black smoke dissolves, with your in-breath, into the very core of your self-grasping at your heart. There it destroys completely all traces of self-cherishing, thereby purifying all your negative karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4. Imagine now that your self-cherishing has been destroyed, that the heart of your enlightened mind, your Bodhichitta, is fully revealed. As you breathe out, then, imagine that you are sending out its brilliant, cooling light of peace, joy, happiness, and ultimate well-being to your friend in pain, and that its rays are purifying all their negative karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Here I find it inspiring to imagine, as Shantideva suggests, that your Bodhichitta has transformed your heart, or your whole body and being itself, into a dazzling, wish-fulfilling jewel, a jewel that can grant the desires and wishes of anyone, and provide exactly what he or she longs for and needs. True compassion <i class="calibre3"> is</i> the wish-fulfilling jewel because it has the inherent power to give precisely to each being whatever that being most needs, and so alleviate his or her suffering, and bring about his or her true fulfillment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">5. So at the moment the light of your Bodhichitta streams out to touch your friend in pain, it is essential to feel a firm conviction that all of his or her negative karma <i class="calibre3"> has</i> been purified, and a deep, lasting joy that he or she has been totally freed of suffering and pain. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as you go on breathing normally, in and out, continue steadily with this practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Practicing Tonglen on one friend in pain helps you to begin the process of gradually widening the circle of compassion to take on the suffering and purify the karma of all beings, and to give them all your happiness, well-being, joy, and peace of mind. This is the wonderful goal of Tonglen practice, and in a larger sense, of the whole path of compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre2">TONGLEN FOR A DYING PERSON<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I think you can begin to see how Tonglen could be directed specifically toward helping the dying, how much strength and confidence it could give you when you come to help them, and how much actual transforming help it could offer them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have given you the main Tonglen practice. Imagine now, in the place of your friend in pain, the person who is dying. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Go through exacdy the same stages as in the main Tonglen. In the visualization in part 3, imagine every aspect of the dying person's suffering and fear gathering into the mass of hot, black, grimy smoke, which you then breathe in; and consider too that by so doing, as before, you are destroying your self-grasping and self-cherishing, and purifying all your negative karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, as before, imagine, as you are breathing out, the light of the heart of your enlightened mind is filling the dying person with its peace and well-being and purifying all his or her negative karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At every moment in our lives we need compassion, but what more urgent moment could there be than when we are dying? What more wonderful and consoling gift could you give to the dying than the knowledge that they are being prayed for, and that you are taking on their suffering and purifying their negative karma through your practice for them? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if they don't know that you are practicing for them, you are helping them and in turn they are helping you. They are <i class="calibre3"> actively</i> helping you to develop your compassion, and so purify and heal yourself. For me, every dying person is a teacher, giving all those who help them a chance to transform themselves through developing their compassion.8 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE HOLY SECRET </p>
<p class="calibre2">You may be asking yourself this question: "If I take in the sufferings and pain of others, won't I risk harming myself?" If you feel at all hesitant or feel that you don't yet have the strength or courage of compassion to do the practice of Tonglen wholeheartedly, don't worry. Just <i class="calibre3"> imagine</i> yourself doing it, saying in your mind, "As I breathe in, I am taking on the suffering of my friend or others, and as I breathe out, I am giving him or them happiness and peace." Just simply doing this might create the climate in your mind that could inspire you to begin practicing Tonglen directly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you feel at all hesitant or unable to do the full practice, you can also do Tonglen in the form of a simple <i class="calibre3"> prayer, </i> deeply aspiring to help beings. You might pray for example: "May I be able to take on the suffering of others; may I be able to give my well-being and happiness to them." This prayer will create auspicious conditions for the awakening of your power to do Tonglen in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">212 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">The one thing you should know for certain is that the only thing that Tonglen <i class="calibre3"> could</i> harm is the one thing that has been harming you the most: your own ego, your self-grasping, self-cherishing mind, which is the root of suffering. For if you practice Tonglen as often as possible, this self-grasping mind will get weaker and weaker, and your true nature, compassion, will be given a chance to emerge more and more strongly. The stronger and greater your compassion, the stronger and greater your fearlessness and confidence. So compassion reveals itself yet again as your greatest resource and your greatest protection. As Shantideva says: <i class="calibre3">Whoever wishes to quickly afford protection</i> <i class="calibre3">To both himself and others </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Should practice that holy secret </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The exchanging of self for others.9 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">This holy secret of the practice of Tonglen is one that the mystic masters and saints of every tradition know; and living it and embodying it, with the abandon and fervor of true wisdom and true compassion, is what fills their lives with joy. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One modern figure who dedicated her life to serving the sick and dying and who radiated this joy of giving and receiving was Mother Teresa. I know of no more inspiring statement of the spiritual essence of Tonglen than these words of hers: <i class="calibre3">We all long for heaven where God is, but we have it in our power</i> <i class="calibre3">to be in heaven with Him at this very moment. But being happy</i> <i class="calibre3">with Him now means: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Loving as He loves, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Helping as He helps, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Giving as He gives, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Serving as He serves, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Rescuing as He rescues, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Being with Him twenty-four hours, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Touching Him in his distressing disguise. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">A love as vast as this cured Geshe Chekhawa's lepers of their leprosy; it could also perhaps cure us of a disease even more dangerous: of that ignorance, which life after life has hindered us from realizing the nature of our mind, and so of attaining liberation. </p>
<p id="p213" class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THIRTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Spiritual Help for the Dying </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I FIRST CAME TO THE WEST at the beginning of the 1970s, and what disturbed me deeply, and has continued to disturb me, is the almost complete lack of spiritual help for the dying that exists in modern culture. In Tibet, as I have shown, everyone had some knowledge of the higher truths of Buddhism and some relationship with a master. No one died without being cared for, in both superficial and profound ways, by the community. I have been told many stories of people dying alone and in great distress and disillusion in the West without any spiritual help, and one of my main motiva-tions in writing this book is to extend the healing wisdom of the world I was brought up in to all men and women. Do we not all have a right, as we are dying, not only to have our bodies treated with respect, but also, and perhaps even more important, our spirits? Shouldn't one of the main rights of any civilized society, extended to everyone in that society, be the right to die surrounded by the best spiritual care? Can we really call ourselves a "civilization" until this becomes an accepted norm? What does it really mean to have the technology to send people to the moon, when we do not know how to help our fellow humans die with dignity and hope? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Spiritual care is not a luxury for a few; it is <i class="calibre3"> the</i> essential right of every human being, as essential as political liberty, medical assistance, and equality of opportunity. A real demo-cratic ideal would include knowledgeable spiritual care for everyone as one of its most essential truths. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wherever I go in the West, I am struck by the great mental suffering that arises from the fear of dying, whether or not this fear is acknowledged. How reassuring it would be for people if they knew that when they lay dying they would be cared for with loving insight! As it is, our culture is so heartless in its expediency and its denial of any real spiritual value that people, 213 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">214 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">when faced with terminal illness, feel terrified that they are simply going to be thrown away like useless goods. In Tibet it was a natural response to pray for the dying and to give them spiritual care; in the West the only spiritual attention that the majority pay to the dying is to go to their funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the moment of their greatest vulnerability, then, people in our world are abandoned and left almost totally without support or insight. This is a tragic and humiliating state of affairs, which must change. All of the modern world's preten-sions to power and success will ring hollow until everyone can die in this culture with some measure of true peace, and until at least some effort is made to ensure this is possible. </p>
<p class="calibre2">BY THE BEDSIDE OF THE DYING<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">A friend of mine, who had just graduated from a famous medical school, started work at one of the larger London hospitals. On her very first day on the ward, four or five people died. It was a terrible shock for her; nothing in her training had equipped her to deal with it at all. Isn't this astonishing, considering she was being trained to be a doctor? One old man was lying in his bed, staring at the wall. He was alone, with no family or friends to visit him, and he was desperate for someone to talk to. She went over to him. His eyes filled with tears and his voice trembled as he asked her the last question she expected to hear: "Do you think God will ever forgive me for my sins?" My friend had no idea at all how to respond; her training had left her completely unprepared for any spiritual questions. She had nothing to say; all she had to hide behind was her professional status as a doctor. There was no chaplain close by, so she just stood there, paralyzed, unable to answer her patient's desperate call for help and for reassurance about the meaning of his life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">She asked me, in her pain and bewilderment: "What would you have done?" I said to her I would have sat by his side, held his hand, and let him talk. I have been amazed again and again by how, if you just let people talk, giving them your complete and compassionate attention, they will say things of a surprising spiritual depth, even when they think they don't have any spiritual beliefs. Everyone has their own life wisdom, and when you let a person talk you allow this life wisdom to emerge. I have often been very moved by how you can help people <i class="calibre3"> to help themselves</i> by helping them to discover their own truth, a truth whose richness, sweetness, and profundity they SPIRITUAL HELP FOR THE DYING  2 1 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">may never have suspected. The sources of healing and awareness are deep within each of us, and your task is never under any circumstances to impose your beliefs but to enable them to find these within themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Believe as you sit by the dying person that you are sitting by someone who has the true potential to be a buddha. Imagine their buddha nature as a shining and stainless mirror, and all their pain and anxiety a thin, gray mist on it that can quickly clear. This will help you to see them as lovable and forgivable, and draw out of you your unconditional love; you will find this attitude will allow the dying person to open remarkably to you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My master Dudjom Rinpoche used to say that to help a dying person is like holding out a hand to someone who is on the point of falling over, to lift them up. Through the strength and peace and deep compassionate attention of your presence, you will help them awaken their own strength. The quality of your <i class="calibre3"> presence</i> at this most vulnerable and extreme moment is all-important. As Cicely Saunders wrote: 'The dying have shed the masks and superficialities of everyday living and they are all the more open and sensitive because of this. They see through all unreality. I remember one man saying, 'No, no reading. I only want what is in your mind and in your heart.'"1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">I never go to the bedside of a dying person without practicing beforehand, without steeping myself in the sacred atmosphere of the nature of mind. Then I do not have to struggle to find compassion and authenticity, for they will be there and radiate naturally. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember, you can do nothing to inspire the person in front of you if you do not inspire yourself first. So when you don't know what to do, when you feel hardly able to do anything to help, then pray and meditate, invoke the Buddha or any other figure whose sacred power you believe in. When I'm faced with someone going through terrible suffering, I call down with fervor the help of all the buddhas and enlightened beings, with my heart completely open to the person dying in front of me, and compassion for their pain filling my being. I invoke as intensely as possible the presence of my masters, the buddhas, of those enlightened beings with whom I have a particular connection. Summoning all my powers of devotion and faith, I see them in glory above the dying person, gazing down at them with love, and pouring down light and blessing on them, purifying them of all their past karma and present agony. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">216 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">And as I do this, I keep praying that the person in front of me should be spared further suffering, and find peace and liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I do this with the deepest concentration and earnestness, and then I try to rest in the nature of my mind and allow its peace and radiance to permeate the atmosphere of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Many, many times I have been awed by the sense of sacred presence that then establishes itself very naturally, and which in turn inspires the dying person. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I'm now going to say something that may surprise you. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Death can be very inspiring. </i> In my experiences with dying people, I have found that I have surprised myself by the way in which my prayer and invocation transformed the atmosphere, and I myself have had my faith deepened by seeing how effective this invocation and prayer and this presence of the buddhas are. I have found that being by the bedside of a dying person has made my own practice far more powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes I see that the dying person also feels this atmosphere of deep inspiration, and is grateful to have provided the opportunity for our reaching, together, a moment of real and transformative rapture. </p>
<p class="calibre2">GIVING HOPE AND FINDING FORGIVENESS </p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to single out two points in giving spiritual help to the dying: giving hope, and finding forgiveness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Always when you are with a dying person, dwell on what they have accomplished and done well. Help them to feel as constructive and as happy as possible about their lives. Concentrate on their virtues and not their failings. People who are dying are frequently extremely vulnerable to guilt, regret, and depression; allow them to express these freely, listen to the person and acknowledge what he or she says. At the same time, where appropriate, be sure to remind the person of his or her buddha nature, and encourage the person to try to rest in the nature of mind through the practice of meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially remind the person that pain and suffering are not all that he or she is. Find the most skillful and sensitive way possible to inspire the person and give him or her hope. So rather than dwelling on his or her mistakes, the person can die in a more peaceful frame of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To the man who cried out: "Do you think God will ever forgive me for my sins?" I would say: "Forgiveness already exists SPIRITUAL HELP FOR THE DYING  2 1 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">in the nature of God; it is already there. God has already forgiven you, for God is forgiveness itself. To err is human, and to forgive divine.' But can you truly forgive yourself? That's the real question. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Your feeling of being unforgiven and unforgivable <i class="calibre3"> is</i> what makes you suffer so. But it only exists in your heart or mind. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Haven't you read how in some of the near-death experiences a great golden presence of light arrives that is all-forgiving? </p>
<p class="calibre2">And it is very often said that it is finally <i class="calibre3"> we</i> who judge ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"In order to clear your guilt, ask for purification from the depths of your heart. If you really ask for purification, and go through it, forgiveness will be there. God will forgive you, just as the father in Christ's beautiful parable forgives the prodigal son. To help yourself to forgive yourself, remember the good things you have done, forgive everyone else in your life, and ask for forgiveness from anyone you may have harmed." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Not everyone believes in a formal religion, but I think nearly everyone believes in forgiveness. You can be of immeasurable help to the dying by enabling them to see the approach of death as the time for reconciliation and reckoning. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Encourage them to make up with friends or relatives, and to clear their heart, so as not to keep even a trace of hatred or the slightest grudge. If they cannot meet the person from whom they feel estranged, suggest they phone them or leave a taped message or letter and ask for forgiveness. If they suspect that the person they want to pardon them cannot do so, it is not wise to encourage them to confront the person directly; a negative response would only add to their already great distress. And sometimes people need time to forgive. Let them leave a message of some kind asking for forgiveness, and they will at least die knowing that they have done their best. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They will have cleared the difficulty or anger from their heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Time and time again, I have seen people whose hearts have been hardened by self-hatred and guilt find, through a simple act of asking for pardon, unsuspected strength and peace. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All religions stress the power of forgiveness, and this power is never more necessary, nor more deeply felt, than when someone is dying. Through forgiving and being forgiven, we purify ourselves of the darkness of what we have done, and prepare ourselves most completely for the journey through death. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">218 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">FINDING A SPIRITUAL PRACTICE<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">If your dying friend or relative is familiar with some kind of meditation practice, encourage him or her to rest in meditation as much as possible, and meditate with the person as death approaches. If the dying person is at all open to the idea of spiritual practice, help the person find a suitable, simple practice, do it with him or her as often as possible, and keep reminding the person gently of it as death nears. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Be resourceful and inventive in how you help at this crucial moment, for a great deal depends on it: The whole atmosphere of dying can be transformed if people find a practice they can do wholeheartedly before and as they die. There are so many aspects of spiritual practice; use your acumen and sensitivity to find the one they might be most connected with: it could be forgiveness, purification, dedication, or feeling the presence of light or love. And as you help them begin, pray for the success of their practice with all your heart and mind; pray for them to be given every energy and faith to follow the path they choose. I have known people even at the latest stages of dying make the most startling spiritual progress by using one prayer or one mantra or one simple visualization with which they really made a connection in their heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Stephen Levine tells the story of a woman he was counsel-ing who was dying of cancer.2 She felt lost because, although she had a natural devotion to Jesus Christ, she had left the church. Together they explored what she might do to strengthen that faith and devotion. She came to the realization that what would help her renew her connection with Christ, and find some trust and confidence while dying, would be to repeat continuously the prayer, "Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me." Saying this prayer opened her heart, and she began to feel Christ's presence with her at all times. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE ESSENTIAL PHOWA PRACTICE<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">The most valuable and powerful of all practices I have found in caring for the dying, one which I have seen an astonishing number of people take to with enthusiasm, is a practice from the Tibetan tradition called <i class="calibre3"> phowa</i> (pronounced "po-wa"), which means the transference of consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Phowa for dying people has been performed by friends, relatives, or masters, quite simply and naturally, all over the modern world—in Australia, America, and Europe. Thousands SPIRITUAL HELP FOR THE DYING  2 1 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">of people have been given the chance to die serenely because of its power. It gives me joy to make the <i class="calibre3"> heart</i> of the phowa practice now available to anyone who wishes to use it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to emphasize that this is a practice that anyone at all can do. It is simple, but it is also the most essential practice we can do to prepare for our own death, and it is the main practice I teach my students for helping their dying friends and relatives, and their loved ones who have already died. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Practice One </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">First make sure you are comfortable, and assume the meditative posture. If you are doing this practice as you are coming close to death, just sit as comfortably as you are able, or practice lying down. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then bring your mind home, release, and relax completely. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1. In the sky in front of you, invoke the embodiment of whatever truth you believe in, in the form of radiant light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Choose whichever divine being or saint you feel close to. If you are a Buddhist, invoke a buddha with whom you feel an intimate connection. If you are a practicing Christian, feel with all your heart the vivid, immediate presence of God, the Holy Spirit, Jesus, or the Virgin Mary. If you don't feel linked with any particular spiritual figure, simply imagine a form of pure golden light in the sky before you. The important point is that you consider the being you are visualizing or whose presence you feel <i class="calibre3"> is</i> the embodiment of the truth, wisdom, and compassion of all the buddhas, saints, masters, and enlightened beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't worry if you cannot visualize them very clearly, just fill your heart with their presence and trust that they are there. </p>
<p class="calibre2">2. Then focus your mind, heart, and soul on the presence you have invoked, and pray: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Through your blessing, grace, and guidance, through the power of</i> <i class="calibre3">the light that streams from you: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May all my negative karma, destructive emotions, obscurations,</i> <i class="calibre3">and blockages be purified and removed, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May I know myself forgiven for all the harm I may have thought</i> <i class="calibre3">and done, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May I accomplish this profound practice of phowa, and die a good</i> <i class="calibre3">and peaceful death, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And through the triumph of my death, may I be able to benefit all</i> <i class="calibre3">other beings, living or dead. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">220 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. Now imagine that the presence of light you have invoked is so moved by your sincere and heartfelt prayer that he or she responds with a loving smile and sends out love and compassion in a stream of rays of light from his or her heart. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As these touch and penetrate you, they cleanse and purify all your negative karma, destructive emotions, and obscurations, which are the causes of suffering. You see and feel that you are totally immersed in light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">4. You are now completely purified and completely healed by the light streaming from the presence. Consider that your very body, itself created by karma, now dissolves completely into light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">5. The body of light you are now soars up into the sky and merges, inseparably, with the blissful presence of light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">6 <i class="calibre3">. </i> Remain in that state of oneness with the presence for as long as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Practice Two </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">1. To do this practice even more simply, begin as before by resting quietly, and then invoke the presence of the embodiment of truth. </p>
<p class="calibre2">2. Imagine your consciousness as a sphere of light at your heart, which flashes out from you like a shooting star, and flies into the heart of the presence in front of you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">3. It dissolves and merges with the presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Through this practice you are investing your mind in the wisdom mind of the Buddha or enlightened being, which is the same as surrendering your soul into the nature of God. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche says this is like casting a pebble into a lake; think of it plummeting down into the water, deeper and deeper. Imagine that through the blessing your mind is transformed into the wisdom mind of this enlightened presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Practice Three </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">The most essential way to do the practice is this: Simply merge your mind with the wisdom mind of the pure presence. Consider: "My mind and the mind of the Buddha are one." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Choose whichever one of these versions of the phowa feels most comfortable, or has most appeal for you at any particular moment. Sometimes the most powerful practices can be the most simple. But whichever one you choose, remember that it is essential to take the time now to become familiar with this SPIRITUAL HELP FOR THE DYING  2 2 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">practice. How else will you have the confidence to do it for yourself or others at the moment of death? My master Jamyang Khyentse wrote, "If you meditate and practice in this manner always, at the moment of death it will come easier."3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact you should be so familiar with the practice of phowa that it becomes a natural reflex, your second nature. If you have seen the film <i class="calibre3"> Gandhi, </i> you know that when he was shot, his immediate response was to call out: "Ram  . . . Ram!" </p>
<p class="calibre2">which is, in the Hindu tradition, the sacred name of God. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember that we never know how we will die, or if we will be given the time to recall any kind of practice at all. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What time will we have, for example, if we smash our car into a truck at 100 mph on the freeway? There won't be a second then to think about how to do phowa, or to check the instructions in this book. Either we are familiar with the phowa or we are not. There is a simple way to gauge this: Just look at your reactions when you are in a critical situation or in a moment of crisis, such as an earthquake, or a nightmare. Do you respond with the practice or don't you? And if you do, how stable and confident is your practice? </p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember a student of mine in America who went out riding one day. The horse threw her; her foot got stuck in the stirrup, and she was dragged along the ground. Her mind went blank. She tried desperately to recall some practice, but nothing at all would come. She grew terrified. What was good about that terror was that it made her realize that her practice had to become her second nature. This was the lesson she had to learn; it is the lesson, in fact, we all have to learn. Practice phowa as intensively as you can, until you can be sure you will react with it to any unforeseen event. This will make certain that whenever death comes, you will be as ready as you can be. </p>
<p class="calibre2">USING<b class="calibre4"> </b>THE ESSENTIAL PHOWA PRACTICE </p>
<p class="calibre2">TO HELP THE DYING<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">How can we use this practice to help someone who is dying? </p>
<p class="calibre2">The principle and the sequence of the practice are exactly the same; the only difference is that you visualize the Buddha or spiritual presence above the head of the dying person: Imagine that the rays of light pour down onto the dying person, purifying his or her whole being, and then he or she dissolves into light and merges into the spiritual presence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">222 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Do this practice throughout your loved one's illness, and especially (and most important) when the person is breathing the last breath, or as soon as possible after breathing stops and before the body is touched or disturbed in any way. If the dying person knows you are going to do this practice for them, and knows what it is, it can be a great source of inspiration and comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sit quiedy with the dying person, and offer a candle or light in front of a picture or statue of Buddha or Christ or the Virgin Mary. Then do the practice for them. You can be doing the practice quiedy, and the person need not even know about it; on the other hand, if he or she is open to it, as sometimes dying people are, share the practice and explain how to do it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">People often ask me: "If my dying relative or friend is a practicing Christian and I am a Buddhist, is there any conflict?" </p>
<p class="calibre2">How could there be? I tell them: You are invoking the truth, and Christ and Buddha are both compassionate manifestations of truth, appearing in different ways to help beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I strongly suggest to doctors and nurses that they can also do phowa for their dying patients. Imagine how marvelously it could change the atmosphere in a hospital if those who were ministering to the dying were also doing this practice. I remember the death of Samten in my childhood, when my master and the monks were all practicing for him. How powerful and uplifting it was! My deepest prayer is for everyone to die with the same grace and peace that he did. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have formulated this essential phowaspecially from the traditional Tibetan practice for dying, and it incorporates all the most important principles. So it is not only a practice for dying, but it can also be used both to purify and to heal; it is important for the living, and for the sick as well. If a person is going to be healed, it will assist that healing; if a person is dying, it will help them and heal their spirit in death; and if the person has died, it will continue to purify them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you are not sure whether a person who is seriously ill is going to live or die, then whenever you visit them you can do this phowa practice for them. And when you go home, do it again. The more you do it, the more your dying friend will be purified. You never know if you will see your friend again, or if you will be present when he or she actually dies. So seal each visit with this practice, just as a preparation, and go on doing the practice in whatever spare moments you have.4 </p>

<p class="calibre2">From the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead: </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">O son/daughter of an enlightened family,5 what is called "death" </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">has now arrived, so adopt this attitude: "I have arrived at the time</i> <i class="calibre3">of death, so now, by means of this death, I will adopt only the</i> <i class="calibre3">attitude of the enlightened state of mind, loving kindness and compassion, and attain perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings who are as limitless as space." </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently one of my students came to me and said: "My friend is only twenty-five. He's in pain and dying of leukemia. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He is already frighteningly bitter; I'm terrified that he'll drown in bitterness. He keeps asking me: 'What can I do with all this useless, horrible suffering?'" </p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart went out to her and her friend. Perhaps nothing is as painful as believing that there is no use to the pain you are going through. I told my student there was a way her friend could transform his death even now, and even in the great pain he was enduring: to dedicate, with all his heart, the suffering of his dying, and his death itself, to the benefit and ultimate happiness of others. </p>
<p class="calibre2">1 told her to tell him: "I know how much pain you're in. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Imagine now all the others in the world who are in a pain like yours, or even greater. Fill your heart with compassion for them. And pray to whomever you believe in and ask that your suffering should help alleviate theirs. Again and again dedicate your pain to the alleviation of their pain. And you will quickly discover in yourself a new source of strength, a compassion you'll hardly be able now to imagine, and a certainty, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that your suffering is not only not being wasted, but has now a marvelous meaning." </p>
<p class="calibre2">What I was describing to my student was in fact the practice of Tonglen, which I have already shared with you, but which takes on a very special significance when someone is terminally ill or dying. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If you have an illness like cancer or AIDS, try as intensely as you can to imagine every other person in the world who has the same disease as you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Say to yourself with deep compassion: "May I take on the suffering of everyone who has this terrible illness. May they be free from this affliction and from all their suffering." </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">224 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then imagine that their illness and tumors leave their body in the form of smoke, and dissolve into your illness and tumors. When you breathe in, you breathe in all their suffering, and when you breathe out, you breathe out total healing and well-being. Each time you do this practice, believe, with complete conviction, that they are now healed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As you approach death, think continually to yourself: "May I take on the suffering, the fear, and loneliness of all others all over the world who are dying or will die. May they be all freed from pain and confusion; may they all find comfort and peace of mind. May whatever suffering I am enduring now and will endure in the future help them toward a good rebirth and ultimate enlightenment." </p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew an artist in New York who was dying from AIDS. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He was a sardonic character and hated institutional religion, although secretly some of us suspected he had more spiritual curiosity than he admitted. Friends persuaded him to see a Tibetan master, who immediately understood that the greatest source of his frustration and suffering was that he felt his pain was of no use to himself or to anyone else. So he taught him one thing, and one thing only: the Tonglen practice. Despite some initial skepticism, he did practice it; and all his friends saw he went through an extraordinary change. He told many of them that, through Tonglen, the pain that before had been pointless and horrific was now infused with an almost glorious purpose. Everyone who knew him experienced firsthand how this new sense of meaning transformed his dying. He died in peace, reconciled to himself and his suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If the practice of taking on the suffering of others can transform someone who has little experience of practice before, then imagine what power it has in the hands of a great master. When Gyalwang Karmapa died in Chicago in 1981, one of his Tibetan disciples wrote: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">By the time that I saw him, His Holiness had already had many</i> <i class="calibre3">operations, some farts of his body removed, things put inside</i> <i class="calibre3">him, his blood transfused, and so on. Every day the doctors discovered the symptoms of some new disease, only to find them</i> <i class="calibre3">gone the next day and replaced by another illness, as if all the</i> <i class="calibre3">diseases in the world were finding room in his flesh. For two</i> <i class="calibre3">months he had taken no solid food, and finally his doctors gave</i> <i class="calibre3">up hope. It was impossible for him to live, and the doctors</i> <i class="calibre3">thought the life-supporting systems should be disconnected. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">But the Karmapa said, "No, I'm going to live. Leave them in</i> SPIRITUAL HELP FOR THE DYING  2 2 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">place." And he did live, astonishing the doctors, and remaining</i> <i class="calibre3">seemingly at ease in his situation</i>— <i class="calibre3">humorous, playful, smiling, as</i> <i class="calibre3">if he were rejoicing at everything his body suffered. Then I thought,</i> <i class="calibre3">with the clearest possible conviction, that the Karmapa had submit-ted himself to all this cutting, to the manifestation of all those diseases in his body, to the lack of food, in a quite intentional and</i> <i class="calibre3">voluntary way. He was deliberately suffering all of these diseases</i> <i class="calibre3">to help minimize the coming pains of war, disease, and famine,</i> <i class="calibre3">and in this way he was deliberately working to avert the terrible</i> <i class="calibre3">suffering of this dark age. For those of us present, his death was</i> <i class="calibre3">an unforgettable inspiration. It profoundly revealed the efficacy of</i> <i class="calibre3">the Dharma,6 and the fact that enlightenment for the sake of others</i> <i class="calibre3">can actually be achieved.7 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I know and I firmly believe that there is no need for anyone on earth to die in resentment and bitterness. No suffering, however dreadful, is or can be meaningless if it is dedicated to the alleviation of the suffering of others. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We have before us the noble and exalting examples of the supreme masters of compassion, who, it is said, live and die in the practice of Tonglen, taking on the pain of all sentient beings while they breathe in, and pouring out healing to the whole world when they breathe out, all their lives long, and right up until their very last breath. So boundless and powerful is their compassion, the teachings say, that at the moment of their death, it carries them immediately to rebirth in a buddha realm. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How transformed the world and our experience of it would be if each of us, while we live and as we die, could say this prayer, along with Shantideva and all the masters of compassion: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">May I be a protector to those without protection,</i> <i class="calibre3">A leader for those who journey, </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">And a boat, a bridge, a passage </i></p>

<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Until everyone is healed. </i></p>

<p id="p214" class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">FOURTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Practices for Dying </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">I REMEMBER HOW PEOPLE would often come to see my master, Jamyang Khyentse, simply to ask for his guidance for the moment of death. He was so loved and revered throughout Tibet, especially in the eastern province of Kham, that some would travel for months on end to meet him and get his blessing just once before they died. All my masters would give this as their advice, for this is the essence of what is needed as you come to die: "Be free of attachment and aversion. Keep your mind pure. And unite your mind with the Buddha." </p>
<p class="calibre2">The whole Buddhist attitude toward the moment of death can be summed up in this one verse by Padmasambhava from the cycle of the <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead:</i> <i class="calibre3">Now when the bardo of dying dawns upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will abandon all grasping, yearning, and attachment,</i> <i class="calibre3">Enter undistracted into clear awareness of the teaching,</i> <i class="calibre3">And eject my consciousness into the space of unborn Rigpa;</i> <i class="calibre3">As I leave this compound body of flesh and blood</i> <i class="calibre3">I will know it to be a transitory illusion. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">At the moment of death, there are two things that count: whatever we have done in our lives, and what state of mind we are in at that moment. Even if we have accumulated a lot of negative karma, if we are able really to make a change of heart at the moment of death, it can decisively influence our future and transform our karma, for the moment of death is an exceptionally powerful opportunity for purifying karma. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE MOMENT OF DEATH<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember that all the habits and tendencies that are stored in the ground of our ordinary mind are lying ready to be 227 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">228 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">activated by any influence. Even now we know how it only takes the slightest provocation to prompt our instinctive, habitual reactions to surface. This is especially true at the moment of death. The Dalai Lama explains: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">At the time of death attitudes of long familiarity usually take precedence and direct the rebirth. For this same reason, strong attachment is generated for the self since one fears that one's self is</i> <i class="calibre3">becoming nonexistent. This attachment serves as the connecting link</i> <i class="calibre3">to the intermediate state between lives, the liking for a body in turn</i> <i class="calibre3">acts as a cause establishing the body of the intermediate (bardo)</i> <i class="calibre3">being.1 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore our state of mind at death is all-important. If we die in a positive frame of mind, we can improve our next birth, despite our negative karma. And if we are upset and distressed, it may have a detrimental effect, even though we may have used our lives well. This means that <i class="calibre3"> the last thought and</i> <i class="calibre3">emotion that we have before we die has an extremely powerful determining effect on our immediate future. </i> Just as the mind of a mad person is usually entirely occupied by one obsession, which returns again and again, so at the moment of death our minds are totally vulnerable and exposed to whatever thoughts then preoccupy us. That last thought or emotion we have can be magnified out of all proportion and flood our whole perception. This is why the masters stress that the quality of the atmosphere around us when we die is crucial. With our friends and relatives, we should do all we can to inspire positive emotions and sacred feelings, like love, compassion, and devotion, and all we can to help them to "let go of grasping, yearning, and attachment." </p>
<p class="calibre2">LETTING GO OF ATTACHMENT </p>
<p class="calibre2">The ideal way for a person to die is having given away everything, internally and externally, so that there is as little as possible yearning, grasping, and attachment for the mind at that essential moment to latch onto. So before we die we should try to free ourselves of attachment to all our possessions, friends, and loved ones. We cannot take anything with us, so we should make plans to give away all our belongings beforehand as gifts or offerings to charity. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet the masters, before they left their bodies, would indicate what they would like to offer to other teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 2 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes a master who was intending to reincarnate in the future would leave a particular group of objects for his reincarnation, giving a clear indication of what he wanted to leave. I am convinced that we should also be exact about who is going to receive our possessions or our money. These wishes should be expressed as lucidly as possible. If they are not, then after you die, if you are in the bardo of becoming, you will see your relatives squabbling over your goods or misusing your money, and this will disturb you. State precisely just how much of your money should be dedicated to charity or different spiritual purposes, or given to each of your relatives. Making everything clear, down to the final details, will reassure you and help you truly to let go. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As I have said, it is essential that the atmosphere around us when we die should be as peaceful as possible. The Tibetan masters therefore advise that grieving friends and relatives should not be present at a dying person's bedside, in case they provoke a disturbing emotion at the moment of death. Hospice workers have told me that dying people sometimes request that their close family do not visit them just as they are dying, because of this very fear of evoking painful feelings and strong attachment. Sometimes this may be extremely difficult for families to understand; they may feel they are no longer loved by the dying person. However, they should bear in mind that the mere presence of loved ones may provoke strong feelings of attachment in the dying person, which make it harder than ever for him or her to let go. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is extremely hard not to cry when we are at the bedside of a loved one who is dying. I advise everyone to do their best to work out attachment and grief with the dying person before death comes: Cry together, express your love, and say goodbye, but try to finish with this process before the actual moment of death arrives. If possible, it is best if friends and relatives do not show excessive grief at the moment of death, because the consciousness of the dying person is at that moment exceptionally vulnerable. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says that your crying and tears around a person's bedside are experienced like thunder and hail. But don't worry if you have found yourself weeping at a deathbed; it can't be helped, and there is no reason to upset yourself and to feel guilty. </p>
<p class="calibre2">One of my great-aunts, Ani Pelu, was an extraordinary spiritual practitioner. She had studied with some of the legendary 230 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">masters of her time, especially with Jamyang Khyentse, and he blessed her by writing for her a special "heart advice." She was sturdy and round, very much the boss of our household, with a beautiful and noble face and a yogin's uninhibited, even temperamental, nature. She seemed to be a very practical woman, and she took direct charge of administering the family's affairs. Yet a month before she died she changed completely, in the most moving way. She who had been so busy let everything drop, with a calm and carefree abandon. She seemed to be continually in a state of meditation, and kept singing out her favorite passages from the writings of Longchenpa, the Dzogchen saint. She had enjoyed eating meat; yet just before she died, she didn't want to touch meat at all. She had been the queen of her world, and few people had thought of her as a<a href="http://yog.nl" class="calibre5"> <i class="calibre3"> yogini</i> I</a>n her dying she showed who she really was, and I shall never forget the profound peace that radiated from her in those days. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ani Pelu, in many ways, was my guardian angel; I think she loved me specially because she had no children of her own. My father was always very busy being Jamyang Khyentse's administrator, and my mother was also busy with her huge household; she did not think of things that Ani Pelu never forgot. Ani Pelu would often ask my master: "What's going to happen to this boy when he grows up? Is he going to be all right? Is he going to have obstacles?" and sometimes he would reply to her and say things he would never have said about my future if she had not been there to badger him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At the end of her life, Ani Pelu had tremendous serenity in her being and stability in her spiritual practice, yet even she, when she was at the point of death, made a request that I should not be present, just in case her love for me might cause her an instant's attachment. This shows how seriously she took her beloved master Jamyang Khyentse's heart advice: "At the moment of death, abandon all thoughts of attachment and aversion." </p>
<p class="calibre2">ENTERING THE CLEAR AWARENESS<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her sister Ani Rilu had also spent her whole life practicing, and had met the same great masters. She had a thick volume of prayers, and she would recite prayers and practice all day long. From time to time she would doze off, and when she woke up again she would carry on practicing from where she had left off. All day and all night she did the same thing, so THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 3 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">that she hardly ever slept the whole night through, and often she ended up doing her morning practice in the evening and her evening practice in the morning. Her elder sister, Pelu, was a much more decisive and orderly person, and toward the end of her life she could not stand this endless disruption of normal routine. She would say: "Why don't you do the morning practice in the morning and the evening practice in the evening, and switch the light off and go to bed like everybody else does?" Ani Rilu would murmur, "Yes  . . . yes," but go on just the same. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In those days I would have been rather on Ani Peru's side, but now I see the wisdom of what Ani Rilu was doing. She was immersing herself in a stream of spiritual practice, and her whole life and being became one continuous flow of prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, I think her practice was so strong that she continued praying even in her dreams, and anyone who does that will have a very good chance of liberation in the bardos. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ani Rilu's dying had the same peaceful and passive quality as her life. She had been ill for some time, and it was nine o'clock one winter morning when the wife of my master sensed that death was approaching quickly. Although by that time Ani Rilu could not speak, she was still alert. Someone was sent immediately to ask Dodrupchen Rinpoche, a remarkable master who lived nearby, to come to give the last guidance and to effect the phowa, the practice of the transference of consciousness at the moment of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In our family there was an old man called A-pe Dorje, who died in 1989 at the age of eighty-five. He had been with my family for five generations, and was a man whose grandfatherly wisdom and common sense, exceptional moral strength and good heart, and gift for reconciling quarrels made him for me the embodiment of everything good that is Tibetan: a rugged, earthy, ordinary person who lives spontaneously by the spirit of the teachings.2 He taught me so much as a child, most especially, how important it is to be kind to others and never to harbor negative thoughts even if someone harms you. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He had a natural gift of imparting spiritual values in the most simple way; he almost charmed you into being your best self. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A-pe Dorje was a born storyteller, and he would keep me enthralled as a child with fairy stories and tales from the Gesar epic, or accounts of the struggles in the eastern provinces, when China invaded Tibet in the early 1950s. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wherever he went he brought a lightness and joy, and a humor that would make any difficult situation seem less 232 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">complicated. Even when he was nearing his eighties, I remember, he was sprightly and active and went shopping every day almost till his death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A-pe Dorje used to go shopping every morning around nine. He had heard that Ani Rilu was on the verge of death, and came to her room. He had a habit of speaking rather loudly, almost shouting. 'Ani Rilu," he called out. She opened her eyes. "My dear girl," he beamed at her affectionately with his enchanting smile, "now is the moment to show your true mettle. Don't falter. Don't waver. You have been so blessed to have met so many wonderful masters and received teachings from all of them. Not only that, but you have had the priceless opportunity to practice as well. What more could you ask for? Now, the only thing you need to do is to keep the essence of the teachings in your heart, and especially the instruction for the moment of death that your masters have given you. Keep that in your mind, and do not be distracted. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry about us, we'll be fine. I'm going shopping now, and perhaps when I come back, I won't see you. So, goodbye." He said this with a huge grin. Ani Rilu was still alert and the way he said it made her smile in recognition, and give a little nod. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A-pe Dorje knew that it is vital, as we come near to death, to essentialize all our spiritual practice into one "heart practice" </p>
<p class="calibre2">that embodies everything. What he said to Ani Rilu sums up the third line in the verse by Padmasambhava, which tells us, at the moment of death, to: "Enter, undistracted, into clear awareness of the teaching." </p>
<p class="calibre2">For someone who has gained recognition of the nature of mind and stabilized it in his or her practice, this means to rest in the state of Rigpa. If you do not have that stability, remember, in your innermost heart, the essence of your master's teaching, especially the most essential instructions for the moment of death.  <i class="calibre3"> Hold that in your mind and heart, and think of</i> <i class="calibre3">your master, and unite your mind as one with him or her as you die. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">An image that is often given to characterize the bardo of dying is that of a beautiful actress sitting in front of her mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Her final performance is about to begin, and she is putting on her makeup and checking her appearance for the last time before going out on stage. In just the same way, at the moment of death the master reintroduces us to the essential THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 3 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">truth of the teachings—in the mirror of the nature of mind— </p>
<p class="calibre2">and points us directly to the heart of our practice. If our master is not present, spiritual friends who have a good karmic connection with us should be there to help remind us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that the best time for this introduction is after the outer breathing has ceased and before the end of the "inner respiration," though it is safest to began during the dissolution process, before the senses have completely failed. If you will not have the opportunity to see your master just before your death, you will need to receive and acquaint yourself with these instructions well beforehand. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If the master is present at the deathbed, what he or she does then in our tradition follows this sequence. The master first declares words like: "O son/daughter of an enlightened family, listen without distraction..." and then leads us through the stages of the dissolution process, one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then he or she will essentialize the heart of the introduction powerfully and explicitly, in a few pungent words, so that it creates a strong impression on our mind, and ask us to rest in the nature of mind. In case this is beyond our capacity, the master will remind us of the phowa practice, if we are familiar with it; if not, he or she will effect the phowa practice for us. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as a further precaution, the master might also explain the nature of the experiences of the bardos after death, and how they are all, without exception, the projections of our own mind, and inspire us with the confidence to recognize this at every moment. "O son or daughter, whatever you see, however terrifying it is, recognize it as your own projection; recognize it as the luminosity, the natural radiance of your mind."3 Finally the master will instruct us to remember the pure realms of the buddhas, to generate devotion, and to pray to be reborn there. The master will repeat the words of the introduction three times and, remaining in the state of Rigpa, direct his or her blessing toward the dying disciple. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE PRACTICES FOR DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are three essential practices for dying: </p>
<p class="calibre2">• At best, resting in the nature of mind, or evoking the heart-essence of our practice </p>
<p class="calibre2">• Next, the phowa practice, the transference of consciousness </p>
<p class="calibre2">• Last, relying on the power of prayer, devotion, aspiration, and the blessings of enlightened beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">234 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Supreme practitioners of Dzogchen, as I have said, have completely realized the nature of mind during their lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So when they die, they need only to continue to rest and abide in that state of Rigpa, as they make the transition through death. They have no need to transfer their consciousness into any buddha or enlightened realm, for they have already made real the wisdom mind of the buddhas within themselves. Death, for them, is the moment of ultimate liberation—the crowning moment of their realization, and the consummation of their practice. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> has only these few words to remind such a practitioner: "O Sir! </p>
<p class="calibre2">Now the Ground Luminosity is dawning. Recognize it, and rest in the practice." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who have completely accomplished the practice of Dzogchen are said to die <i class="calibre3"> "like a new-born child</i>" free of all care and concern about death. They do not need to concern themselves with when or where they will die, nor do they have any need of teachings, instructions, or reminders. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Medium practitioners of the best capacity" die <i class="calibre3"> "like beggars</i> <i class="calibre3">in the street." </i> No one notices them and nothing disturbs them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the stability of their practice, they are absolutely unaffected by the environment around them. They could die with the same ease in a busy hospital, or at home in the middle of a nagging and squabbling family. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I shall never forget an old yogin I knew in Tibet. He used to be like a Pied Piper, and all the children would follow him around. Everywhere he went, he would chant and sing, drawing the whole community around him, and he would tell them all to practice and to say "OM MANI PADME HUM," </p>
<p class="calibre2">the mantra of the Buddha of Compassion.4 He had a big prayer wheel; and whenever anyone gave him something, he would sew it onto his clothes, so that he ended up looking like a prayer wheel himself as he turned about. Also, I remember, he had a dog who followed him everywhere. He treated the dog like a human being, ate the same food as the dog from the same bowl, slept next to him, looked on him as his best friend, and regularly even talked to him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Not many people took him seriously, and some called him a "crazy yogin," but many Lamas spoke highly of him and said we should not look down on him. My grandfather and my family would always treat him with respect, and would invite him into the shrine room and offer him tea and bread. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet it was the custom never to visit someone's home empty-handed, and one day, in the middle of drinking his tea, THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 3 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">he stopped: "Oh! I'm sorry, I almost forgot... this is my gift for you!" He picked up the very bread and white scarf my grandfather had just offered him, and gave them back to him as if they were a present. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Often he used to sleep outside in the open air. One day, in the precincts of the Dzogchen monastery, he passed away: with his dog by his side, right in the middle of the street, and in a pile of garbage. No one expected what happened next, but it was witnessed by many people. All around his body appeared a dazzling sphere of rainbow-colored light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that "medium practitioners of middling capacity die <i class="calibre3">like wild animals or lions, on snow mountains, in mountain caves and</i> <i class="calibre3">empty valleys." </i> They can take care of themselves completely and prefer to go to deserted places and die quietly, without being disturbed or fussed over by friends and relatives. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Accomplished practitioners such as these are reminded by the master of the practices they would employ as they approach death. Here are two examples from the tradition of Dzogchen. In the first, practitioners are advised to lie down in the "sleeping lion position." Then they are told to focus their awareness in their eyes, and fix their gaze in the sky in front of them. Simply leaving their mind unaltered, they rest in that state, allowing their Rigpa to mix with the primordial space of truth. As the Ground Luminosity of death arises, they flow into it quite naturally and attain enlightenment. </p>
<p class="calibre2">But this is only possible for a person who has already stabilized his or her realization of the nature of mind through the practice. For those who have not reached this level of perfection, and need a more formal method to focus on, there is another practice: To visualize their consciousness as a white syllable "A," and eject it through the central channel and out through the crown of their heads into the buddha realm. This is a practice of phowa, the transference of consciousness, and it is the method my master helped Lama Tseten do when he died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">People who successfully accomplish either of these two practices will still go through the physical processes of dying, it is said, but they will not go through the subsequent bardo states. </p>
<p class="calibre2">PHOWA: THE TRANSFERENCE </p>
<p class="calibre2">OF<b class="calibre4"> </b>THE CONSCIOUSNESS<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now that the bardo of dying dawns upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will abandon all grasping, yearning, and attachment,</i> 236 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Enter undistracted into clear awareness of the teaching,</i> <i class="calibre3">And eject my consciousness into the space of unborn Rigpa;</i> <i class="calibre3">As I leave this compound body of flesh and blood</i> <i class="calibre3">I will know it to be a transitory illusion. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ejecting the consciousness into the space of unborn Rigpa" </p>
<p class="calibre2">refers to the transference of consciousness, the phowa practice, which is the most commonly used practice for dying, and the special instruction associated with the bardo of dying. Phowa is a practice of yoga and meditation that has been used for centuries to help the dying and to prepare for death. The principle is that at the moment of death, the practitioner ejects his or her consciousness and merges it with the wisdom mind of the Buddha, in what Padmasambhava calls "the space of unborn Rigpa." This practice can be carried out by the individual, or effected by a qualified master or good practitioner on the individual's behalf. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are many categories of phowa corresponding to the capacities, experience, and training of different individuals. But the phowa practice most commonly used is known as the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"phowa of three recognitions": <i class="calibre3"> recognition of our central channel5 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">as the path; recognition of our consciousness as the traveler; and recognition of the environment of a buddha realm as the destination. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ordinary Tibetan people with responsibilities of work and family are not able to devote all their lives to study and practice, yet they have tremendous faith and trust in the teachings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When their children grow up and they approach the end of their lives—what in the West would be called "retirement"— </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tibetans often go on pilgrimage or meet masters and concentrate on spiritual practice; frequently they will undertake a training in phowa to prepare for death. Phowa is often referred to in the teachings as a method of attaining enlightenment without a lifelong experience of meditation practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In the phowa practice, the central presence invoked is that of the Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless Light. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Amitabha enjoys widespread popularity among ordinary people in China and Japan, as well as in Tibet and the Himalayas. He is the primordial Buddha of the Lotus or Padma family, which is the buddha family to which human beings belong; he represents our pure nature and symbolizes the transmutation of desire, the predominant emotion of the human realm. More intrinsically, Amitabha is the limitless, luminous nature of our mind. At death the true nature of mind will manifest at the moment of the dawning of the Ground Luminosity, yet not all THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 3 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">of us may have the familiarity with it to recognize it. How skillful and compassionate the buddhas are to have handed down to us a method for invoking the very embodiment of the luminosity in the radiant presence of Amitabha! </p>
<p class="calibre2">It would be inappropriate here to explain the details of the traditional phowa practice, which must, always and in all circumstances, be carried out under the guidance of a qualified master. Never try to do this practice on your own without the proper guidance. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At death, the teachings explain, our consciousness, which is mounted on a "wind" and so needs an aperture through which to leave the body, can leave it through any one of nine openings. The route it takes determines exactly which realm of existence we are to be reborn in. When it leaves through the opening at the fontanel, at the crown of the head, we are reborn, it is said, in a pure land, where we can gradually proceed toward enlightenment.6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">This practice, I must stress again, can only be carried out under the supervision of a qualified master, who has the blessing to give the proper transmission. It does not require extensive intellectual knowledge or depth of realization to accomplish the phowasuccessfully, only devotion, compassion, one-pointed visualization, and a deep feeling of the presence of the Buddha Amitabha. The student receives the instructions and then practices them until the signs of accomplishment appear. These include an itching at the top of the head, headaches, the emergence of a clear fluid, a swelling or a softness around the area of the fontanel, or even the opening of a small hole there, into which traditionally the tip of a stalk, of grass is inserted as a test or measure of how successful the practice has been. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently a group of elderly Tibetan laypeople settled in Switzerland trained under a well-known phowa master. Their children, who had been brought up in Switzerland, were skeptical about the effectiveness of this practice. But they were astounded at how their parents had been transformed and actually showed some of the signs of accomplishment mentioned above after a ten-day phowa retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Research into the psychophysiological effects of phowa has been carried out by the Japanese scientist Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama. Precise physiological changes in the nervous, metabolic, and acupuncture meridian systems were detected to take place during phowa practice.7 One of Dr. Motoyama's find-ings was that the patterns of the flow of energy through the meridians of the body of the phowa master he was studying 238 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">were very similar to those measured in psychics with strong ESP abilities. He also found, from EEG (electroencephalograph) measurements, that brain waves during the phowa practice were quite different from those found in yogins practicing other kinds of meditation. They showed that phowa involves the stimulation of a certain part of the brain, the hypothalamus, as well as the stopping of ordinary conscious mental activity, in order to allow a deep state of meditation to be experienced. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes it is the case that through the blessing of the phowa, ordinary people will have strong visionary experiences. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Their glimpses of the peace and light of the Buddha realm, and their visions of Amitabha, are reminiscent of certain aspects of the near-death experience. And, as in the near-death experience, success in the phowa practice also brings confidence and fearlessness in facing the moment of death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The essential phowa practice I have explained in the previous chapter is as much a healing practice for the living as a practice for the moment of death, and can be done <i class="calibre3"> at any time</i> <i class="calibre3">without danger. </i> However, the timing of the traditional phowa practice is of paramount importance. For example, it is said that if one were actually to transfer one's consciousness successfully before the moment of natural death, it would be equivalent to suicide. The point when the phowa is done is when the outer respiration has ceased, and the inner breathing still continues; but perhaps it is safest to begin the phowa practice during the dissolution process (described in the next chapter), and to repeat the practice several times. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So when a master who has perfected the traditional phowa performs it for a dying person, visualizing the consciousness of the person and ejecting it out through the fontanel, it is essential that the timing is right and it is not done too early. An advanced practitioner, however, with knowledge of the process of death, can check details such as the channels, the movement of the winds, and the heat of the body to see when the moment for phowa has come. If a master is requested to do the transference for someone who is dying, he or she should be contacted as soon as possible, because even from a distance phowa can still be effected. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A number of obstacles to a successful phowa can present themselves. As any unwholesome frame of mind, or even the smallest longing for any possession, will be a hindrance when the time of death arrives, you should try not to be dominated THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 3 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">by even the slightest negative thought or hankering. In Tibet they used to believe that phowa would be very difficult to accomplish if there were any materials made of animal skins or furs in the same room as the dying person. Finally, as smoking—or any kind of drug—has the effect of blocking the central channel, it will render the phowa more difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Even a great sinner," it is said, can be liberated at the moment of death if a realized and powerful master transfers the person's consciousness into a buddha realm. And even if the dying person lacks merit and practice, and the master is not completely successful in effecting the phowa, the master can still affect the dying person's future, and this practice can help him or her take rebirth in a higher realm. For a successful phowa, however, the conditions do have to be perfect. Phowa can help a person with strong negative karma, but only if that person has a close and pure connection with the master who performs it, if he or she has faith in the teachings, and if he or she has truly asked, from the heart, for purification. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In an ideal setting in Tibet, members of the family would normally invite many Lamas to come and do the phowa again and again, until the signs of accomplishment appeared. They might do it for hours on end, hundreds of times, or even the whole day long. Some dying persons would take only one or two sessions of phowa to manifest a sign, whereas for others not even a whole day was enough. This, it goes without saying, depends very much on the karma of the person dying. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet there were practitioners who, even though they were not renowned for their practice, had special power to effect the phowa, and the signs would readily appear. There are various signs in the dying person of a successful phowa carried out by a practitioner. Sometimes a bunch of hair falls out near the fontanel, or a warmth or vapor is felt or seen to rise from the crown of the head. In some exceptional cases, the masters or practitioners have been so powerful that when they uttered the syllable that effects the transference, everyone in the room would faint, or a piece of bone would fly off the dead person's skull as the consciousness was propelled out with immense force.8 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE GRACE OF PRAYER </p>
<p class="calibre2">AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">In all religious traditions it is held that to die in a state of prayer is enormously powerful. So what I hope you can do, as 240 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">you die, is to invoke wholeheartedly all the buddhas and your master. Pray that, through regretting all your negative actions in this and other lives, they may be purified, and that you may die consciously and at peace, gain a good rebirth, and ultimately achieve liberation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Make a one-pointed and concentrated wish that you will be reborn either in a pure realm or as a human being, but in order to protect, nurture, and help others. To die with such love and such tender compassion in your heart until your last breath is said in the Tibetan tradition to be another form of phowa, and it will ensure that you will at least attain another precious human body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">To create the most positive possible imprint on the mindstream before death is essential. The most effective practice of all to achieve this is a simple practice of Guru Yoga, where the dying person merges his or her mind with the wisdom mind of the master, or Buddha, or any enlightened being. Even if you cannot visualize your master at this moment, try at least to remember him, think of him in your heart, and die in a state of devotion. When your consciousness awakens again after death, this imprint of the master's presence will awaken with you, and you will be liberated. If you die remembering the master, then the possibilities of his or her grace are limitless: even the display of sound, light, and color in the bardo of dharmata may arise as the master's blessing and the radiance of his or her wisdom nature. </p>
<p class="calibre2">If the master is present at the deathbed, he or she will ensure that the mindstream of the dying person is imprinted with his or her presence. The master may, to retrieve the dying person from other distractions, make some striking and significant remark. He or she might say in a loud voice: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember me!" The master will draw the dying person's attention in whatever way is necessary, and create an indelible impression that will return as a memory of the master in the bardo state. When one well-known teacher's mother was dying and slipping into a coma, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was present at her bedside and did something very unusual. He slapped her on the leg. If she did not forget Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche as she entered into death, she would have been blessed indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In our tradition ordinary practitioners will also pray to whichever buddha they feel devotion for, and with whom they feel a karmic connection. If it is Padmasambhava, they will pray to be born in his glorious pure realm, the Palace of THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 4 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Lotus Light on the Copper-Colored Mountain; and if it is Amitabha they love and revere, they will pray to be reborn in his "Blissful" heaven, the marvelous Pure Land of Dewachen.9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE ATMOSPHERE FOR DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">How then do we most sensitively help ordinary spiritual practitioners who are dying? All of us will need the love and care that comes with emotional and practical support, but for spiritual practitioners the atmosphere, intensity, and dimension of spiritual help take on a special meaning. It would be ideal, and a great blessing, if their master were with them; but if this is not possible, their spiritual friends can be of enormous help in reminding the dying of the essence of the teachings and the practice that has been closest to their heart during life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For a practitioner who is dying, spiritual inspiration, and the atmosphere of trust and faith and devotion that will naturally arise from it, are essential. The loving and unflagging presence of the master or spiritual friends, the encouragement of the teachings, and the strength of their own practice, all combine together to create and sustain this inspiration, as precious in the last weeks and days almost as breath itself. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A beloved student of mine was dying of cancer, and asked me how best she should practice as she came nearer to death, particularly when she no longer had the strength to concentrate on any formal practice. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Remember just how very fortunate you have been," I told her, "to have met so many masters, received so many teachings, and had the time and possibility to practice. I promise you, the benefit of all that will never leave you: The good karma you have created by it will stay with you and help you. Even to hear the teaching once, or meet a master like Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and have a strong connection with him as you did, is liberating in itself. Never forget that, and never forget also how many people there are in your position who did not have that marvelous opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"If the time comes when you cannot practice actively any more, the only really important thing for you to do is to relax, as deeply as possible, in the confidence of the View, and rest in the nature of mind. It does not matter whether your body or your brain are still functioning: the nature of your mind is always there, sky-like, radiant, blissful, limidess and unchanging. Know that beyond all doubt, and let that knowledge give you the strength to say with carefree abandon to all your 242 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">pain, however great it is: "Go away now, and leave me alone!' </p>
<p class="calibre2">If there is anything that irritates you or makes you feel uncomfortable in any way, don't waste your time trying to change it; keep returning to the View. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Trust in the nature of your mind, trust it deeply, and relax completely. There is nothing new you need to learn or acquire or understand; just allow what you have already been given to blossom in you and open at greater and greater depths. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Rely on whatever for you is the most inspiring of all the practices. And if it is difficult for you to visualize or follow a formal kind of practice, remember what Dudjom Rinpoche always used to say: that to feel the presence is more important than getting the details of the visualization clear. Now is the time to feel, as intensely as you can, to feel with your whole being the presence of your masters, of Padmasambhava, of the buddhas. Whatever may be happening to your body, remember that your heart is never sick or crippled. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"You have loved Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Feel his presence, and really ask him for help and purification. Put yourself entirely in his hands: heart and mind, body and soul. The simplicity of total trust is one of the most powerful forces in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Did I ever tell you that beautiful story about Ben of Kongpo? He was a very simple man, with immense faith, who came from Kongpo, a province in southeastern Tibet. He had heard a lot about the Jowo Rinpoche, the 'Precious Lord,' </p>
<p class="calibre2">a beautiful statue of Buddha as a prince at the age of twelve that is kept in the central cathedral in Lhasa. It is said to have been made while the Buddha was alive, and is the most holy statue in the whole of Tibet. Ben could not make out whether it was a buddha or a human being, and he was determined to go and visit the Jowo Rinpoche to see what all the talk was about. So he put on his boots and walked, week after week, to get to Lhasa in central Tibet. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"He was hungry when he arrived, and when he entered the cathedral, he saw the great statue of Buddha, and in front of it a row of butter-lamps and special cakes made as offerings to the shrine. He assumed at once that these cakes were what the Jowo Rinpoche ate: 'The cakes,' he said to himself, 'must be for dipping into the butter in the lamps, and the lamps must be kept alight to stop the butter from going hard. I'd better do what Jowo Rinpoche does.' So he dipped one in the butter and ate it, looking up at the statue, which seemed to be smiling down benignly just at him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 4 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">"What a nice Lama you are he said.  T h e dogs come in and steal the food people offer you, and all you do is smile. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The wind blows out the lamps, and still you keep on smiling </p>
<p class="calibre2">. . . Anyway, I am going to walk all around the temple in prayer, to show my respect. Would you mind looking after my boots till I get back?' Taking off his dirty old boots, he placed them on the altar in front of the statue, and left. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"While Ben was walking around the huge temple, the caretaker returned and saw to his horror that someone had been eating the offerings and had left a filthy pair of boots on the altar. He was outraged, and furiously seized the boots to throw them outside, when a voice came from the statue, saying: 'Stop! Put those boots back. I am watching them for Ben of Kongpo.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Soon Ben came back to collect his boots, and gazed up at the face of the statue, still calmly smiling at him. You really are what I'd call a good Lama. Why don't you come down to our place next year? I will roast a pig and brew some beer.' </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Jowo Rinpoche spoke for a second time, and promised he would visit Ben. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Ben went home to Kongpo, told his wife everything that had happened, and instructed her to keep an eye open for the Jowo Rinpoche, because he didn't know exactly when he was coming. The year went by, and one day his wife came rushing back to the house to tell him she had seen something glowing like the sun, under the surface of the river. Ben told her to put the water on for tea, and raced down to the river. He saw the Jowo Rinpoche glittering in the water, and immediately thought he must have fallen in and was drowning. He leapt into the water, took hold of him, and carried him out. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"As they went back to Ben's house, chatting all the way, they came to a huge rock face. The Jowo Rinpoche said: </p>
<p class="calibre2">'Well, actually I'm afraid I cannot come into the house,' and with that he dissolved into the rock. To this day there are two famous places of pilgrimage in Kongpo: one is the Rock Jowo, the rock face where a form of Buddha can be seen, and the other is the River Jowo, where the shape of Buddha can be seen in the river. People say that the blessing and the healing powers of these places are identical to the Jowo Rinpoche in Lhasa. And it was all because of Ben's immense faith and simple trust. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"I want you to have the same kind of pure trust as Ben. Let your heart fill with devotion for Padmasambhava and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and simply feel you are in his presence, 244 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">that the whole space around you is him. Then invoke him and go over in your mind every moment you spent with him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Merge your mind with his and say, from the depths of your heart, in your own words, 'You see how helpless I am, how I can no longer practice intensively. Now I must rely totally on you. I trust you completely. Take care of me. Make me one with you.' Do the Guru Yoga practice, imagining with special intensity the rays of light streaming out from your master and purifying you, burning away all your impurities, your illness too, and healing you; your body melting into light; and merging your mind, in the end, with his wisdom mind, in complete confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"When you practice, don't worry if you feel it is not flowing easily; simply trust and feel it in your heart. Everything now depends on inspiration, because only that will relax your anxiety and dissolve your nervousness. So keep a wonderful photograph of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, or Padmasambhava, in front of you. Focus on it gently at the beginning of your practice, and then just relax into its radiance. Imagine it was sunny outside, and that you could take off all your clothes and bask in the warmth: slip out of all your inhibitions and relax in the glow of the blessing, when you really feel it. And deeply, deeply let go of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Don't worry about anything. Even if you find your attention wandering, there is no particular 'thing' you have to hold onto. Just let go, and drift in the awareness of the blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Don't let small, niggling questions distract you, like 'Is this Rigpa? Is it not?' Just let yourself be more and more natural. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember, your Rigpa is always there, always in the nature of your mind. Remember Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's words: </p>
<p class="calibre2">'If your mind is unaltered, you are in the state of Rigpa.' So as you have received the teachings, you received the introduction to the nature of mind, just relax in the Rigpa, without doubting. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"You are lucky enough to have some good spiritual friends near you now. Encourage them to create an environment of practice around you, and to go on practicing around you up until and after your death. Get them to read you a poem you love, or a guidance from your master, or an inspiring teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ask them to play you a tape of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, a chant of the practice, or an exalting piece of music. What I pray is that your every waking moment should mingle with the blessing of the practice, in an atmosphere alive and luminous with inspiration. </p>

<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Now that the bardo of dying dawns upon me,</i> <i class="calibre3">I will abandon all grasping, yearning, and attachment,</i> <i class="calibre3">Enter undistracted into clear awareness of the teaching,</i> <i class="calibre3">And eject my consciousness into the space of unborn Rigpa;</i> <i class="calibre3">As I leave this compound body of flesh and blood</i> <i class="calibre3">I will know it to be a transitory illusion. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">At present, our body is undoubtedly the center of our whole universe. We associate it, without thinking, with our self and our ego, and this thoughtless and false association continually reinforces our illusion of their inseparable, concrete existence. Because our body seems so convincingly to exist, our "I" seems to exist and "you" seem to exist, and the entire illusory, dualistic world we never stop projecting around us looks ultimately solid and real. When we die this whole compound construction falls dramatically to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What happens, to put it extremely simply, is that consciousness, at its subtlest level, continues without the body and goes through the series of states called "bardos." The teachings tell us that it is precisely because we no longer have a body in the bardos that there is no ultimate reason to fear any experience, however terrifying, that may happen to us after death. How can any harm, after all, ever come to a "nobody"? The problem, however, is that in the bardos, most people go on grasping at a false sense of self, with its ghosdy grasping at physical solidity; and this continuation of that illusion, which has been at the root of all suffering in life, exposes them in death to more suffering, especially in the "bardo of becoming." </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">246 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">What is essential, you can see, is to realize now, in life, when we still have a body, that its apparent, so convincing solidity is a mere illusion. The most powerful way to realize this is to leam how, after meditation, to "become a child of illusion": to refrain from solidifying, as we are always tempted to do, the perceptions of ourselves and our world; and to go on, like the "child of illusion," seeing directly, as we do in meditation, that all phenomena are illusory and dream like. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The deepening perception of the body's illusory nature is one of the most profound and inspiring realizations we can have to help us to let go. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Inspired by and armed with this knowledge, when we are faced at death with the <i class="calibre3"> fact</i> that our body is an illusion, we will be able to recognize its illusory nature without fear, to calmly free ourselves from all attachment to it, and to leave it behind willingly, even gratefully and joyfully, knowing it now for what it is. In fact, you could say, we will be able, really and completely,  <i class="calibre3"> to die when we die, </i> and so achieve ultimate freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Think, then, of the moment of death as a strange border zone of the mind, a no-man's land in which on the one hand, if we do not understand the illusory nature of our body, we might suffer vast emotional trauma as we lose it; and on the other hand, we are presented with the possibility of limitless freedom, a freedom that springs precisely from the absence of that very same body. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When we are at last freed from the body that has defined and dominated our understanding of ourselves for so long, the karmic vision of one life is completely exhausted, but any karma that might be created in the future has not yet begun to crystallize. So what happens in death is that there is a </p>
<p class="calibre2">"gap" or space that is fertile with vast possibility; it is a moment of tremendous, pregnant power where the only thing that matters, or could matter, is how exactly our mind <i class="calibre3"> is. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Stripped of a physical body, mind stands naked, revealed startlingly for what it has always been: the architect of our reality. </p>
<p class="calibre2">So if, at the moment of death, we have already a stable realization of the nature of mind, in one instant we can purify all our karma. And if we continue that stable recognition, we will actually be able to end our karma altogether, by entering the expanse of the primordial purity of the nature of mind, and attaining liberation. Padmasambhava explained this: THE PRACTICES FOR DYING  2 4 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Why is it, you might wonder, that during the bardo state you can</i> <i class="calibre3">find stability by merely recognizing the nature of mind for a single</i> <i class="calibre3">instant? The answer is this: at present our mind is encased in a</i> <i class="calibre3">net, the net of the "wind of karma." And the "wind of karma" is</i> <i class="calibre3">encased itself in a net, the net of our physical body The result is</i> <i class="calibre3">that we have no independence or freedom. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">But as soon as our body has separated into mind and matter, in</i> <i class="calibre3">the gap before it has been encased once again in the net of a</i> <i class="calibre3">future body, the mind,10 along with its magical display, has no</i> <i class="calibre3">concrete, material support. For as long as it lacks such a material</i> <i class="calibre3">basis, we are independent</i>— <i class="calibre3">and we can recognize. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">This power to attain stability by just recognizing the nature of mind is like a torch which in one instant can clear away the darkness of eons.  <i class="calibre3"> So if we can recognize the nature</i> <i class="calibre3">of mind in the bardo in the same way as we can now when it is</i> <i class="calibre3">introduced by the master, there is not the slightest doubt that we</i> <i class="calibre3">will attain enlightenment.

<p class="calibre2">FIFTEEN </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The Process of Dying </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">IN THE WORDS OF PADMASAMBHAVA: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Human beings face two causes of death: untimely death and death</i> <i class="calibre3">due to the exhaustion of their natural life span. Untimely death</i> <i class="calibre3">can be averted through the methods taught for prolonging life. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">However, when the cause of death is the exhaustion of the natural</i> <i class="calibre3">life span, you are like, a lamp which has run out of oil. There</i> <i class="calibre3">is no way of averting death by cheating it; you have to get</i> <i class="calibre3">ready to go. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us look now at the two causes of death: the exhaustion of our natural life span, and an obstacle or accident that brings our life to an untimely end. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE EXHAUSTION OF OUR LIFE SPAN<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of our karma, we all have a certain lifespan; and when it is exhausted, it is extremely difficult to prolong our lives. However, a person who has perfected the advanced practices of yoga can overcome even this limit, and actually lengthen his or her life. There is a tradition that sometimes masters will be told by their teachers the length of their life span. Yet they know that through the strength of their own practice, the purity of their link with their students and their practice, and the benefit of their work, they can live longer. </p>
<p class="calibre2">My master told Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche he would live to the age of eighty, but beyond that depended on his own practice; he lived into his eighty-second year. Dudjom Rinpoche was told he had a lifespan of seventy-three, but he lived until the age of eighty-two. </p>
<p class="calibre2">248 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING 249 </p>
<p class="calibre2">UNTIMELY DEATH </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said, on the other hand, that if it is only an obstacle of some kind that threatens us with untimely death, it can be more easily averted—provided, of course, that we have fore-knowledge. In the bardo teachings and Tibetan medical texts, we can find descriptions of signs warning of impending death, some foretelling death within years or months, and others in terms of weeks or days. They include physical signs, certain specific kinds of dreams, and special investigations using shadow images.1 Unfortunately only someone with expert knowledge will be able to interpret these signs. Their purpose is to forewarn a person that his or her life is in danger, and to alert the person to the need for using practices that lengthen life, before these obstacles occur. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Any spiritual practice we do, since it accumulates "merit," </p>
<p class="calibre2">will help prolong our lives and bring good health. A good practitioner, through the inspiration and power of his or her practice, comes to feel psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually whole, and this is both the greatest source of healing and the strongest protection against illness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also special "long-life practices," which summon the life-energy from the elements and the universe through the power of meditation and visualization. When our energy is weak and unbalanced, these longevity practices strengthen and coordinate it, and this has the effect of extending our lifespan. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also many other practices for enhancing life. One is to save the lives of animals that are due to be slaughtered, by buying them and setting them free. This practice is popular in Tibet and the Himalayan regions, where, for example, people often go to the fish market to buy fish and then release them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It is based on the natural karmic logic that taking the life of others or harming them will shorten your life, and giving life will lengthen it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE "PAINFUL" BARDO OF DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">The bardo of dying falls between the moment we contract a terminal illness or condition that will end in death, and the ceasing of the "inner respiration." It is called "painful" because if we are not prepared for what will happen to us at death, it can be an experience of tremendous suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Even for a practitioner the whole process of dying can still be a painful one, as losing the body and this life may be a 250 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">very difficult experience. But if we have had instructions on the meaning of death, we will know what enormous hope there is when the Ground Luminosity dawns at the moment of death. However, there still remains the uncertainty of whether we will recognize it or not, and this is why it is so important to stabilize the recognition of the nature of mind through practice while we are still alive. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Many of us, however, have not had the good fortune to encounter the teachings, and we have no idea of what death really is. When we suddenly realize that our whole life, our whole reality, is disappearing, it is terrifying: We don't know what is happening to us, or where we are going. Nothing in our previous experience has prepared us for this. As anyone who has cared for the dying will know, our anxiety will even heighten the experience of physical pain. If we have not taken care of our lives, or our actions have been harmful and negative, we will feel regret, guilt, and fear. So just to have a measure of familiarity with these teachings on the bardos will bring us some reassurance, inspiration, and hope, even though we may never have practiced and realized them. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For good practitioners who know exactly what is happening, not only is death less painful and fearful but it is the very moment they have been looking forward to; they face it with equanimity, and even with joy. I remember how Dudjom Rinpoche used to tell the story of the death of one realized yogin. He had been ill for a few days, and his doctor came to read his pulse. The doctor detected that he was going to die, but he was not sure whether to tell him or not; his face fell, and he stood by the bedside looking solemn and serious. But the yogin insisted, with an almost childlike enthusiasm, that he tell him the worst. Finally the doctor gave in, but tried to speak as if to console him. He said gravely: "Be careful, the time has come." To the doctor's amazement the yogin was delighted, as thrilled as a little child looking at a Christmas present he is about to open. "Is it really true?" he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">'What sweet words, what joyful news!" He gazed into the sky and passed away directly in a state of deep meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tibet everyone knew that to die a spectacular death was the way to really make a name for yourself if you had not managed to do so already in life. One man I heard of was determined to die miraculously and in a grand style. He knew that often masters will indicate when they are going to die, and summon their disciples together to be present at their death. So this particular man gathered all his friends for a great THE PROCESS OF DYING  2 5 1 </p>
<p class="calibre2">feast around his deathbed. He sat there in meditation posture waiting for death, but nothing happened. After several hours his guests began to get tired of waiting and said to each other, </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Let's start eating." They filled their plates, and then looked up at the prospective corpse and said: "He's dying, he doesn't need to eat." As time went by and still there was no sign of death, the "dying" man became famished himself, and worried that there would soon be nothing left to eat. He got down from his deathbed and joined in the feast. His great deathbed scene had turned into a humiliating fiasco. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Good practitioners can take care of themselves when they die, but ordinary ones will need to have their teacher at their bedside, if possible, or otherwise a spiritual friend who can remind them of the essence of their practice and inspire them to the View. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Whoever we are, it can be a great help to be familiar with the process of dying. If we understand the stages of dying, we will know that all the strange and unfamiliar experiences we are passing through are part of a natural process. As this process begins, it signals the coming of death, and reminds us to alert ourselves. And for a practitioner each stage of dying will be a signpost, reminding us of what is happening to us, and of the practice to do at each point. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">The process of dying is explained in considerable detail in the different Tibetan teachings. Essentially it consists of two phases of dissolution: an outer dissolution, when the senses and elements dissolve, and an inner dissolution of the gross and subde thought states and emotions. But first we need to understand the components of our body and mind, which disintegrate at death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our whole existence is determined by the elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space. Through them our body is formed and sustained, and when they dissolve, we die. We are familiar with the outer elements, which condition the way in which we live, but what is interesting is how these outer elements interact with the inner elements within our own physical body. And the potential and quality of these five elements also exist within our mind. Mind's ability to serve as the ground for all experience is the quality of earth; its continuity and adaptability is water; its clarity and capacity to perceive is fire; its continuous movement is air; and its unlimited emptiness is space. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">252 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">The following explains how our physical body is formed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">An ancient Tibetan medical text states: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The sense consciousnesses arise from one's mind. The flesh, bones,</i> <i class="calibre3">organ of smelling and odors are formed from the earth element. </i></p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The blood, organ of taste, tastes and liquids in the body arise from</i> <i class="calibre3">the water element. The warmth, clear coloration, the organ of sight</i> <i class="calibre3">and form are formed from the fire element The breath, organ of</i> <i class="calibre3">touch and physical sensations are formed from the air element. The</i> <i class="calibre3">cavities in the body, the organ of hearing and sounds are formed</i> <i class="calibre3">from the space element1 </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">"In short," writes Kalu Rinpoche, "it is from mind, which embodies the five elemental qualities, that the physical body develops. The physical body itself is imbued with these qualities, and it is because of this mind/body complex that we perceive the outside world—which in turn is composed of the five elemental qualities of earth, water, fire, wind and space."3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The Tantric Buddhist tradition of Tibet offers an explanation of the body that is quite different from the one most of us are used to. This is of a psycho-physical system, which consists of a dynamic network of subtle channels, "winds" or inner air, and essences. These are called, respectively: <i class="calibre3"> nodi,</i> <i class="calibre3">prana, </i> and <i class="calibre3"> bindu</i> in Sanskrit; and <i class="calibre3"> tsa, lung, </i> and <i class="calibre3"> tikle</i> in Tibetan. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We are familiar with something similar in the meridians and <i class="calibre3">ch'i</i> energy of Chinese medicine and acupuncture. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The human body is compared by the masters to a city, the channels to its roads, the winds to a horse, and the mind to a rider. There are 72,000 subtle channels in the body, but three principal ones: the central channel, running parallel to the spine, and the right and left channels, which run either side of it. The right and left channels coil around the central one at a number of points to form a series of "knots." Along the central channel are situated a number of "channel wheels," the <i class="calibre3"> chakras</i> or energy-centers, from which channels branch off like the ribs of an umbrella. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Through these channels flow the winds, or inner air. There are five root and five branch winds. Each of the root winds supports an element and is responsible for a function of the human body. The branch winds enable the senses to operate. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The winds that flow through all the channels except the central one are said to be impure and activate negative, dualistic thought patterns; the winds in the central channel are called </p>
<p class="calibre2">"wisdom winds."4 </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING  2 5 3 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The "essences" are contained within the channels. There are red and white essences. The principal seat of the white essence is the crown of the head, and of the red essence at the navel. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In advanced yoga practice, this system is visualized very precisely by a yogin. By causing the winds to enter and dissolve in the central channel through the force of meditation, a practitioner can have a direct realization of the luminosity or </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Clear Light" of the nature of mind. This is made possible by the fact that the consciousness is mounted on the wind. So by directing his or her mind to any particular point in the body, a practitioner can bring the winds there. In this way the yogin is imitating what happens at death: when the knots in the channels are released, the winds flow into the central channel, and enlightenment is momentarily experienced. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche tells the story of a retreat master at a monastery in Kham, who was close to his elder brothers. This master had perfected the yoga practice of channels, winds, and essences. One day he asked his attendant: "I am going to die now, so would you please look in the calendar for an auspicious date." The attendant was stunned, but did not dare contradict his master. He looked in the calendar and told him that the following Monday was a day when all the stars were auspicious. The master then said: "Monday is three days away. Well, I think I can make it." When his attendant came back into his room a few moments later, he found the master sitting upright in yogic meditation posture, so still that it looked as though he had passed away. There was no breathing, but a faint pulse was perceptible. He decided not to do anything, but to wait. At noon he suddenly heard a deep exhalation, and the master returned to his normal condition, talked with his attendant in a joyful mood, and asked for his lunch, which he ate with relish. He had been holding his breath for the whole of the morning session of meditation. The reason he did this is that our lifespan is counted as a finite number of breaths, and the master, knowing he was near the end of these, held his breath so that the final number would not be reached till the auspicious day. Just after lunch, the master took a deep breath in again, and held it until the evening. He did the same the next day, and the day after. When Monday came, he asked: </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Is today the auspicious day?" "Yes" replied the attendant. </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Fine, I shall go today," concluded the master. And that day, without any visible illness or difficulty, the master passed away in his meditation. </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">254 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Once we have a physical body, we also have what are known as the five <i class="calibre3"> skandhas</i>—the aggregates that compose our whole mental and physical existence. They are the constituents of our experience, the support for the grasping of ego, and also the basis for the suffering of samsara. They are: form, feeling, perception, intellect, and consciousness, also translated as: form, sensation, recognition, formation, and consciousness. "The five skandhas represent the constant structure of the human psychology as well as its pattern of evolution and the pattern of the evolution of the world. The skandhas are also related to blockages of different types—spiritual ones, material ones, and emotional ones."5 They are examined in great depth in Buddhist psychology. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All of these components will dissolve when we die. The process of dying is a complex and interdependent one, in which groups of related aspects of our body and mind disintegrate simultaneously. As the winds disappear, the bodily functions and the senses fail. The energy centers collapse, and without their supporting winds the elements dissolve in sequence from the grossest to the subtlest. The result is that each stage of the dissolution has its physical and psychological effect on the dying person, and is reflected by external, physical signs as well as inner experiences. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Friends sometimes ask me: Can people like us see these external signs in a friend or relative who is dying? My students who care for the dying have told me that some of these physical signs described below are observed in hospices and hospitals. However, the stages of the outer dissolution may take place extremely quickly and not very obviously, and generally people caring for the dying in the modern world are not looking for them. Often nurses in busy hospitals rely on their intuition and many other factors, such as the behavior of doctors or members of the patient's family, or the state of mind of the dying person, to predict when someone might be dying. They also observe, but not at all in a systematic way, some physical signs, such as the change in skin color, a certain smell sometimes remarked on, and a noticeable change in breathing. Modern drugs, however, may well mask the signs that Tibetan teachings indicate, and there is as yet surprisingly little research in the West on this most important topic. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Doesn't this show how little the process of dying is understood or respected? </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING  2 5 5 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE POSITION FOR DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">Traditionally the position generally recommended for dying is to lie down on the right side, taking the position of "the sleeping Hon," which is the posture in which Buddha died. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The left hand rests on the left thigh; the right hand is placed under the chin, closing the right nostril. The legs are stretched out and very slightly bent. On the right side of the body are certain subtle channels that encourage the "karmic wind" of delusion. Lying on them in the sleeping lion's posture, and closing the right nostril, blocks these channels and facilitates a person's recognition of the luminosity when it dawns at death. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It also helps the consciousness to leave the body through the aperture at the crown of the head, as all the other openings through which it could leave are blocked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE OUTER DISSOLUTION: </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE SENSES  A N D THE ELEMENTS </p>
<p class="calibre2">The outer dissolution is when the senses and elements dissolve. How exacdy will we experience this when we die? </p>
<p class="calibre2">The first thing we may be aware of is how our senses cease to function. If people around our bed are talking, there will come a point where we can hear the sound of their voices but we cannot make out the words. This means that the ear consciousness has ceased to function. We look at an object in front of us, and we can only see its outline, not its details. This means that the eye consciousness has failed. And the same happens with our faculties of smell, taste, and touch. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When the senses are no longer fully experienced, it marks the first phase of the dissolution process. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The next four phases follow the dissolution of the elements. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Earth </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Our body begins to lose all its strength. We are drained of any energy. We cannot get up, stay upright, or hold anything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We can no longer support our head. We feel as though we are falling, sinking underground, or being crushed by a great weight. Some traditional texts say that it is as if a huge mountain were being pressed down upon us, and we were being squashed by it. We feel heavy and uncomfortable in any position. We may ask to be pulled up, to have our pillows made higher, or for the bedcovers to be taken off. Our complexion 256 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">fades and a pallor sets in. Our cheeks sink, and dark stains appear on our teeth. It becomes harder to open and close our eyes. As the aggregate of form is dissolving, we become weak and frail. Our mind is agitated and delirious, but then sinks into drowsiness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">These are signs that the <i class="calibre3"> earth</i> element is withdrawing into the water element. This means that the wind related to the earth element is becoming less capable of providing a base for consciousness, and the ability of the water element is more manifest. So the "secret sign" that appears in the mind is a vision of a shimmering mirage. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Water </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">We begin to lose control of our bodily fluids. Our nose begins to run, and we dribble. There can be a discharge from the eyes, and maybe we become incontinent. We cannot move our tongue. Our eyes start to feel dry in their sockets. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our lips are drawn and bloodless, and our mouth and throat sticky and clogged. The nostrils cave in, and we become very thirsty. We tremble and twitch. The smell of death begins to hang over us. As the aggregate of feeling is dissolving, bodily sensations dwindle, alternating between pain and pleasure, heat and cold. Our mind becomes hazy, frustrated, irritable, and nervous. Some sources say that we feel as if we were drowning in an ocean or being swept away by a huge river. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3"> water</i> element is dissolving into fire, which is taking over in its ability to support consciousness. So the "secret sign" </p>
<p class="calibre2">is a vision of a haze with swirling wisps of smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Fire </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">Our mouth and nose dry up completely. All the warmth of our body begins to seep away, usually from the feet and hands toward the heart. Perhaps a steamy heat rises from the crown of our head. Our breath is cold as it passes through our mouth and nose. No longer can we drink or digest anything. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The aggregate of perception is dissolving, and our mind swings alternately between clarity and confusion. We cannot remember the names of our family or friends, or even recognize who they are. It becomes more and more difficult to perceive anything outside of us as sound and sight are confused. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kalu Rinpoche writes: "For the individual dying, the inner experience is of being consumed in a flame, being in the middle of a roaring blaze, or perhaps the whole world being consumed in a holocaust of fire." </p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING  2 5 7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3"> fire</i> element is dissolving into air, and becoming less able to function as a base for consciousness, while the ability of the air element to do so is more apparent. So the secret sign is of shimmering red sparks dancing above an open fire, like fireflies. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">Air </i></p>
<p class="calibre2">It becomes harder and harder to breathe. The air seems to be escaping through our throat. We begin to rasp and pant. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our inbreaths become short and labored, and our outbreaths become longer. Our eyes roll upward, and we are totally immobile. As the aggregate of intellect is dissolving, the mind becomes bewildered, unaware of the outside world. Everything becomes a blur. Our last feeling of contact with our physical environment is slipping away. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We begin to hallucinate and have visions: If there has been a lot of negativity in our lives, we may see terrifying forms. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Haunting and dreadful moments of our lives are replayed, and we may even try to cry out in terror. If we have led lives of kindness and compassion, we may experience blissful, heavenly visions, and "meet" loving friends or enlightened beings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">For those who have led good lives, there is peace in death instead of fear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kalu Rinpoche writes: "The internal experience for the dying individual is of a great wind sweeping away the whole world, including the dying person, an incredible maelstrom of wind, consuming the entire universe."6 </p>
<p class="calibre2">What is happening is that the <i class="calibre3"> air</i> element is dissolving into consciousness. The winds have all united in the "life supporting wind" in the heart. So the "secret sign" is described as a vision of a flaming torch or lamp, with a red glow. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Our inbreaths continue to be more shallow, and our outbreaths longer. At this point blood gathers and enters the </p>
<p class="calibre2">"channel of life" in the center of our heart. Three drops of blood collect, one after the other, causing three long, final outbreaths. Then, suddenly, our breathing ceases. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Just a slight warmth remains at our heart. All vital signs are gone, and this is the point where in a modern clinical situation we would be certified as "dead." But Tibetan masters talk of an internal process that still continues. The time between the end of the breathing and the cessation of the "inner respiration" is said to be approximately "the length of time it takes to eat a meal," roughly twenty minutes. But nothing is certain, and this whole process may take place very quickly. </p>

<p class="calibre2">THE INNER DISSOLUTION<b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the inner dissolution, where gross and subtle thought states and emotions dissolve, four increasingly subtle levels of consciousness are to be encountered. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Here the process of death mirrors in reverse the process of conception. When our parents' sperm and ovum unite, our consciousness, impelled by its karma, is drawn in. During the development of the fetus, our father's essence, a nucleus that is described as "white and blissful," rests in the chakra at the crown of our head at the top of the central channel. The mother's essence, a nucleus that is "red and hot," rests in the chakra said to be located four finger-widths below the navel. It is from these two essences that the next phases of the dissolution evolve. </p>
<p class="calibre2">With the disappearance of the wind that holds it there, the white essence inherited from our father descends the central channel toward the heart. As an outer sign, there is an experience of "whiteness," like "a pure sky struck by moonlight." As an inner sign, our awareness becomes extremely clear, and all the thought states resulting from anger, thirty-three of them in all, come to an end. This phase is known as "Appearance." </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then the mother's essence begins to rise through the central channel, with the disappearance of the wind that keeps it in place. The outer sign is an experience of "redness," like a sun shining in a pure sky. As an inner sign, there arises a great experience of bliss, as all the thought states resulting from desire, forty in all, cease to function. This stage is known as </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Increase."7 </p>
<p class="calibre2">When the red and white essences meet at the heart, consciousness is enclosed between them. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, an outstanding master who lived in Nepal, says: 'The experience is like the meeting of the sky and earth." As an outer sign, we experience a "blackness," like an empty sky shrouded in utter darkness. The inner sign is an experience of a state of mind free of thoughts. The seven thought states resulting from ignorance and delusion are brought to an end. This is known as "Full Attainment."8 </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, as we become slightly conscious again, the Ground Luminosity dawns, like an immaculate sky, free of clouds, fog, or mist. It is sometimes called "the mind of clear light of death." His Holiness the Dalai Lama says: 'This consciousness is the innermost subde mind. We call it the buddha nature, the real source of all consciousness. The continuum of this mind lasts even through Buddhahood."9 </p>

<p class="calibre2">THE PROCESS OF DYING  2 5 9 </p>
<p class="calibre2">THE DEATH OF "THE POISONS" <b class="calibre4"> </b></p>
<p class="calibre2">What then is happening when we die? It is as if we are returning to our original state; everything dissolves, as body and mind are unraveled. The three "poisons"—anger, desire, and ignorance—all die, which means that all the negative emotions, the root of samsara, actually cease, and then there is a gap. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And where does this process take us? To the primordial ground of the nature of mind, in all its purity and natural simplicity. Now everything that obscured it is removed, and our true nature is revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">A similar enfolding can happen, as I explained in Chapter 5, </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Bringing the Mind Home," when we practice meditation and have the experiences of bliss, clarity, and absence of thoughts, which indicate, in turn, that desire, anger, and ignorance have momentarily dissolved. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As anger, desire, and ignorance are dying, we are becoming purer and purer. Some masters explain that for a Dzogchen practitioner, the phases of appearance, increase, and attainment are signs of the gradual manifestation of Rigpa. As everything that obscures the nature of mind is dying, the clarity of Rigpa slowly begins to appear and increase. The whole process becomes a development of the state of luminosity, linked to the practitioner's recognition of the clarity of Rigpa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">In Tantra there is a different approach to practicing during the process of dissolution. In the yoga practice of channels, winds, and essences, the Tantric practitioner prepares in life for the process of dying, by simulating the changes of consciousness of the dissolution process, culminating in the experience of the luminosity or "Clear Light." The practitioner also seeks to maintain awareness of these changes as he or she falls asleep. Because what is important to remember is that this sequence of progressively deepening states of consciousness does not only happen when we die. It also occurs, usually unnoticed, as we fall asleep, or whenever we travel from the grosser to subdest levels of consciousness. Some masters have even shown that it also happens in the very psychological processes of our everyday waking state.10 </p>
<p class="calibre2">The detailed account of the dissolution process may seem complicated, yet if we become really familiar with this process, it can be of great benefit. For practitioners there is a range of specialized practices to do at each stage of the dissolution. For example, you can transform the process of dying into a practice of guru yoga. With each stage of the outer 260 THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING </p>
<p class="calibre2">dissolution, you generate devotion and pray to the master, visualizing him or her in the different energy centers. When the earth element dissolves and the sign of the mirage appears, you visualize the master in your heart center. When the water element dissolves and the sign of smoke appears, you visualize the master in your navel center. When the fire element dissolves and the sign of fireflies appears, you visualize the master in the forehead center. And when the air element dissolves and the sign of the torch appears, you focus entirely on transferring your consciousness into the wisdom mind of your master. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There are many descriptions of the stages of dying, differ-ing in small details and in their order. What I have explained here is a description of the general pattern, but it can unfold differently according to the makeup of the individual. I remember when Samten, my master's attendant, was dying, the sequence was most pronounced. But variations can occur owing to the effects of the particular illness of the dying person, and the state of the channels, winds, and essences. The masters say that all living beings, even the smallest insects, go through this process. In the case of a sudden death or an accident, it will still take place, but extremely quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre2">I have found that the easiest way to understand what is happening during the process of dying, with its outer and inner dissolution, is as <i class="calibre3"> a gradual development and dawning of ever</i> <i class="calibre3">more subtle levels of consciousness. </i> Each one emerges upon the successive dissolution of the constituents of body and mind, as the process moves gradually toward the revelation of the very subtlest consciousness of all: the Ground Luminosity or Clear Light. </p>

<p class="calibre2">WE OFTEN HEAR STATEMENTS LIKE:  " Death is the moment of truth," or "Death is the point when we finally come face to face with ourselves." And we have seen how those who go through a near-death experience sometimes report that as they witness their lives replayed before them, they are asked questions such as, "What have you done with your life? What have you done for others?" All of this points to one fact: that in death we cannot escape from who or what we really are. Whether we like it or not, our true nature is revealed. But it is important to know that there are two aspects of our being that are revealed at the moment of death: our absolute nature, and our relative nature—how we are, and have been, in this life. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As I have explained, in death all the components of our body and mind are stripped away and disintegrate. As the body dies, the senses and subtle elements dissolve, and this is followed by the death of the ordinary aspect of our mind, with all its negative emotions of anger, desire, and ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally nothing remains to obscure our true nature, as everything that in life has clouded the enlightened mind has fallen away. And what is revealed is the primordial ground of our absolute nature, which is like a pure and cloudless sky. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This is called the dawning of the Ground Luminosity, or </p>
<p class="calibre2">"Clear Light," where consciousness itself dissolves into the all-encompassing space of truth. The <i class="calibre3"> Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> says of this moment: </p>
<p class="calibre2"> <i class="calibre3">The nature of everything is open, empty and naked like the sky. </i></p>
